Cadence builds improve how you recruit your leg, gluteal, and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke by progressing to your maximal cadence. By reaching your highest cadence possible, you are training the 'on/off' switch in each muscle group to not only work faster but to have less overlap with your other muscle groups. This session trains your hamstring muscles to 'turn off' when your quads 'turn on' and vice-versa, resulting in a more efficient pedal stroke at both high and low cadences.  \n",

The difference is that the overall stress on your system when riding tempo is considerably less than while riding at FTP. That means you can either have harder days before or after a tempo session (compared to a threshold session) or you can increase the duration of those tempo efforts to make the overall training stimulus equal (or greater) than completing several repeats right at your FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis tempo effort is divided into 3 segments of equal duration. While the power is the same across all segments, your target cadence starts and low and increases with each new segment. Starting with a long block of low cadence should fatigue your muscles from the start of your effort. As the effort builds and you create more fatigue, the increased cadence targets will place a greater demand on your cardiovascular system. That will feel like a nice break given the load you have been putting on your muscular system. The cadence targets in the final segment will force your fatigued muscles to maintain good coordination as the faster cadence requires your muscles to switch \"on\" and \"off\" at a faster rate. Between the low-RPM sections and the high-RPM work under fatigue, this tempo session not only helps train your FTP, but also benefits your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou can expect your heart rate to remain low for the power targets during the low cadence segment at the start. As the effort progresses and you reach the final 10 minutes of the high rpm segment, your heart rate might go over Z3, which is not something to worry about. While this session appears \"easy\" at first glance, don't be surprised if your legs are feeling it the next day.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\nBuild 1: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\nBuild 2: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\nBuild 3: 20 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Or maybe you don't have much time and need to get a workout in a hurry.\n\n\nAnd so you reach for our Extra Shot. This is a 20-minute 'booster' you can add on to any existing workout \u2013 or use on its own when you've got limited time. It has no warm-up, warm-down or introductory ramblings as you get in the normal SUF videos. Otherwise, it's just like a normal Sufferfest session: instructions, taunts, great music, much agony.\n\n\nWhen you take on this session fresh, the sustained effort just above threshold stresses both MAP and FTP to an equal extent. If you're doing this at the end of another session (when you're already fatigued), then dial the intensity down to 85%. That will really push your steady-state power production and help your body increase FTP.\n",

Can you hang on under a barrage of attacks? Based on four, ten-minute efforts around threshold, _Defender_ is designed to give you the most bang for your aerobic buck, or in this case, the most Watts at FTP for your Suffering.\n\n\u200b\n\nThere are both psychological as well as physiological benefits to this tremendous workout. Mentally, _Defender_ will improve your sense of pacing for longer efforts near FTP. That's because each effort starts above FTP, and since you're fresh, you'll feel as though you can hold that pace all day. Every two minutes, the pace gradually declines, so you are finishing just below FTP. As the time ticks away, the power targets will drop little by little, but your discomfort will remain about the same. By the fourth effort, you'll find the same efforts far more difficult than in the first. By staying tuned in to what your body is telling you, you'll learn more about managing your efforts around threshold and why it's so important to manage your efforts well at this intensity.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe physiological benefits follow the same lines as those found in The Sufferfest workouts _Who Dares_ or _Fight Club_. Overloading your legs and lungs with efforts above FTP before settling into efforts right at or below FTP forces your body to clear out as many metabolites as possible and process as much oxygen as it can.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat sets _Defender_ apart is how that overload is delivered. While _Who Dares_ achieves this with short sprints, _Defender_ forces you to spend minutes above FTP before simmering back down. This allows your heart rate and breathing rate to get much closer to what they are during a long, steady-state threshold effort. This ensures that \u201coverload\u201d comes in as a steady drip, rather than the sudden burst like that in _Who Dares_. The lower intensity of this overload also changes the types of metabolites produced and the ratios in which they occur. Not only does this keep the enzymes in your body focused on aerobic metabolism, but your body will also respond with fewer stress hormones. This means you're training your aerobic system by overloading it but doing so in a way that leaves you more ready to hit tomorrow's training just as hard.\n",

Two, it helps teach you how to maintain power output when moving in and out of the saddle (a vital skill when going on the attack).\n\n\u200b\n\nOnce we fully delete your AC, your reward is a nice steady tempo effort.

                    "body": "This is one of the most classic interval sessions out there. Whether you're a triathlete, a roadie, a mountain biker, or have simply flipped through cycling magazines looking at whatever workouts they might suggest in their \"5-workouts to make you faster\" articles, you've probably heard of the venerable 2 x 20.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe reason it's so popular is that it's easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo what exactly is 2 x 20? Well, it's two 20-minute blocks at an effort just below your FTP.\nMany refer to this intensity as \"sweet spot\", but we prefer \"sub-threshold\", as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. This ensures your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can cope with but that is pretty close to an effort you wouldn't be able to handle for 20 minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe only way you are going to make it through two of these 20-minute efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5-minutes of the first effort, and most people are tempted to go harder. Do NOT be that person. 99 times out a 100, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, and never even makes to the last 10 minutes. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \"bite\" towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady state efforts. Whether that is a Time Trial, local Climb, breakaway, Triathlon, or even a good old Power Test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key, seeing how your perception of how hard the effort is can steadily climb even though your power remains the same.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right?\nAs we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your LTHR. If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren't going hard enough.\nIf you have never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 of each effort. There is no shame in building up to this full session, so don't be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200b\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body, and understanding what that edge feels like, between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort. That means failing this workout is fairly common, and not at all something to get down about. As long as you learn from the experience\u2014for example, what \"too hard\" feels like 10-minutes in\u2014then you've become a better athlete, even if you didn't make it through the entire workout.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 12 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Time spent in this intensity range will help increase your stroke volume (amount of blood your heart can pump every minute), your lactate threshold, and the mitochondrial density of your muscles (mitochondria are the \"power houses\" of the cells that create energy). All of these things are very important parts of aerobic metabolism and performing your best- especially if you like group rides. This is the typical intensity range that most group rides fall into- not a leisurely pace, but not so fast that people are falling off the back within minutes.

And while most of the climb is actually at tempo and sub-threshold effort, there are enough surges above it that your body will constantly be responding to them to clear out those nasty metabolites. Painsuckers, rejoice!\n\n\u200b\n\nContrary to popular belief, there are greater improvements that can be made in your FTP by working below FTP than there are in working above it. Also, during such a long effort with limited recovery the seemingly lower intensity is actually quite challenging. That\u2019s one of the reasons why the same power target five minutes into this climb feels much harder when it comes again at minute 30.\u00a0 This is a great session to help you work on your ability to maintain concentration and form even when fatigued\u2026so load this one up and climb your way to greater fitness and performance!\n",

A good warm-up leads you into two sets of five 90-second intervals with 3-minutes of \u201crecovery\u201d between each. Instead of full gas intervals followed by super low-intensity recovery, these efforts are hard. Still, the real sting (and training benefit) comes from the incomplete recovery you face between intervals. These \u201crecovery\u201d efforts are at the upper end of Z2, meaning you still need quite a bit of oxygen to keep that power churning.\n\n\u200b\n\nBy keeping the intervals themselves under your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) AND not allowing complete recovery, your body will burn through your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) before the end of each set, forcing your body to produce that power aerobically. For those of you who have tackled the Full Frontal fitness test, your body goes through that same transition near the 3-minute mark of the 5-minute test. With this session, not only is it less painful, but you also end up with more total time in that aerobically-dependent state. Endurance sports are all about churning through as much oxygen as possible, and few other workouts see you churning this hard and for this long.\n",

You do a quick sprint to go after them and quickly get their wheel. The stress of the effort catches up with you, and even though the pace settles down to where it was before, you struggle to hold the wheels.\n\n\u200b\n\nWho Dares is a workout that teaches your body to recover from those efforts more effectively so you can keep riding hard. The workout is based on three 9.5-minute, sub-FTP intervals that feature three sprints: one at the start, one in the middle, and one at the end. These sprints flood your body with metabolites like lactate, then the sustained sub-FTP efforts force your body to clear them out while still working hard.\n\n\u200b\n\nTo make the session even more effective, Who Dares also asks your body to do this work at different cadences, stimulating the nervous system and forcing your body to become even more efficient.\n",

Then just before you really reach the limit of your AC\u2019s ability to recover, we serve up shorter, higher intensity intervals with equally short recovery times. Those shorter efforts push your AC all the way to the edge and then over it. At this point, your cardiovascular system is left to take up the slack, forcing your body into new depths of anaerobic depletion. By the end of this workout, you will have pushed your AC and MAP to their breaking point. Your reward? The ability to hit them even harder the next time you need to put down multiple attacks or surges.\n",

So nicely, in fact, that you\u2019re ready for a more demanding session. This workout includes compound sets which are more difficult but, most importantly, more beneficial than simply doing more sets of a single move. This is because your nervous system has to work overtime to cope with the variety. The number of reps per set is also higher, which will help drive continuous improvement.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince this is a longer session, you may experience considerable fatigue on your first time through. As a result, pay more attention to your form. Your body will want to use as little energy as possible, which can lead to some bad habits when hitting rep after rep of a single move. Thankfully, the constant variation of the compound sets forces you to stay engaged and helps you keep solid form from start to finish.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is the first routine in the Full Body series. It introduces the most basic versions of moves that make up the majority of this program. Some of these moves may seem very basic but we encourage you to focus on perfect form and execution during these early levels so that when we turn up the heat you have things nailed. As you'll see, all the exercises at the lower levels will progress in a similar fashion going forward. We're building strength, but also fine-tuning your nervous system. As the program progresses you'll be asked to complete more difficult variations on each foundational move.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs with all the strength training routines, it helps if you\u2019ve done a warm-up before getting started. That can be one of your favorite yoga routines, riding your bike on the trainer for 5-10 minutes, or doing a personal stretching routine.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

The only problem is that you're stuck with a first-time Directeur Sportif. Can you pull off the win?\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session is all about Max Aerobic Power (MAP), also known as VO2 max training. MAP refers to the maximum rate of oxygen delivery and uptake by your body and is an important metric in the world of endurance sports. During this 30-minute session, you\u2019ll be doing five MAP targeted intervals. The first is 3 minutes long, and each successive interval gets 30 seconds shorter until you end with a final effort of \u201cjust\u201d 60 seconds. The structure of each interval varies to keep you on your toes, some with increases in power, some with decreases.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe cadence targets for this session are generally going to be a little higher than \u201ccomfortable\u201d for most people \u2013 and for a very specific reason. We want to maximize the cardiovascular stress of this session rather than loading up your muscular system. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still feel it in your muscles \u2013 likely all of them.\n\n\u200b\n\nTo keep the total stress of this shorter session fairly high, you\u2019re going to have _just enough_ recovery between each effort, but nothing extra \u2013 so don\u2019t let the short duration fool you into thinking this is going to be easy. On the contrary, you might find this to be one of the more challenging\u2014and productive\u2014sessions in our library. Now, go out there and get that stage win!\n",

Be smart and pace yourself; you can always go harder in the final 5-minute effort if you want to!\n\n\u200b\n\nAt any intensity above Endurance pace, the longer you ride, the more fatigued you become. Completing the final 5-minute target when fresh would be unpleasant, hitting it after all of these other intervals makes it a near maximal effort. Proper hydration/cooling and nutrition are vital if you want to nail this workout.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf you are preparing for any longer ride/event where you will be required to keep on the gas from start to finish, this is the perfect session for you. Completing these efforts in this order not only gives a great physical training boost, but it also toughens you up mentally.

                    "body": "To celebrate the 2017 edition of Sufferlandrian National Day, Grunter von Agony has prepared a symphony of Suffering, unlike anything the world has ever seen. A mashup to rule all mashups, _Kitchen Sink_ is a 3-hour monster that combines the nastiest bits from 11 separate Sufferfest workouts, throwing everything at you but the...well, you get the picture.\n\n\u200b\n\n_Igniter_ lights the fuse, launching you directly into the meat grinder for one of the low-cadence power climbs from _Angels_. Once you\u2019re softened up, the second race simulation from _Hell Hath No Fury_ will have you chasing some of the fastest women in the pro peloton. You\u2019ll have to dig deep but save something for _The Shovel_ and its 23 rapid-fire, all-out efforts.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse than being hit by a shovel? Following it up with blows from two hammers. Two separate VO2 intervals from _Nine Hammers_ will test your resolve, setting you up for a frantic race to the line with the last set of sprint intervals from _Violator_.\n\n\u200b\n\nOnce you cement your status as Speed Demon of Sufferlandria, there will be little time to rest on your laurels. You\u2019ll head straight to the velodrome to leave it all on the track with the Kilo interval from _The Omnium_.\n\n\u200b\n\nAfter that display of raw power, you\u2019ve earned yourself a brief respite. Mike Cotty will lead you over the picturesque Col d\u2019Iseran in _To Get To The Other Side_, bringing you dangerously close to the border with Couchlandria. But don\u2019t get too comfortable. The descent off the backside of the climb leads you directly into _A Very Dark Place_, where the cobbles of Paris-Roubaix will deliver a merciless beating as you fight to hold the wheel of Fabian Cancellara.\n\n\u200b\n\nAssuming you make it out of the pav\u00e9 unscathed, you\u2019ll begin to question why _It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time_ as you tackle the steep side of Mount Sufferlandria, climbing above the treeline until you\u2019re hub-deep in lava snow.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom the summit, you\u2019ll just be able to make out the finish far below. But to get there, you have to descend the last set of intervals from _The Downward Spiral_. Leaving a trail of bloated Painsuckers in your wake, you\u2019ll finally arrive at the end of your epic journey, greeted by crowds of cheering minions and showered in realpagne. Honor, Glory, and Victory are yours. What better way to spend the National Day of Suffering?\n",

We know you can go harder for 25-minutes, but that is not the point of a Tempo Session.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat many people don't realize is that your body's ability to process oxygen and metabolites is nearly identical from 80%-100% of FTP. The main change across that intensity range is the rate at which those metabolites are being generated. While you would get a slightly greater training load from doing this session at a higher power, you would be adding more fatigue to your system than we want. That extra fatigue means you either need to ease off your workouts in the days leading up, or ease off your workouts on the days after. From a big picture point of view that's no good! This session gives a great steady-state aerobic training load, while leaving you fresh enough that you can hit training hard the days before and after. That means your training load over the entire week is often higher when you maintain restraint and stick to those Tempo Targets.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 25 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100\n\nRest: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

This is one of the best ways to improve your FTP without really overloading your system with too much training stress.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe final two intervals allow you to really charge over your threshold to unleash whatever power you have left in your legs. These two all-out bursts of power, in addition to the constant surges above threshold, means this session works your Anaerobic Capacity more than some of the other FTP-focused sessions.\n",

The first two drills, Cadence Holds and Builds, are designed to improve the way you recruit your leg, glute and core muscles throughout your pedal stroke. They do this by forcing you to sustain a cadence just above 'comfortable' and by pushing you to your maximal cadence.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe last drill, Single Leg Efforts, ask you to unclip one leg and ride at a steady, single-legged effort. This forces you to pull up on the pedal instead of just pushing down and ensures maximal muscle awareness and engagement. This workout is best done while riding indoors on a trainer because even small variations in terrain can affect your ability to properly execute this workout. The majority of this workout is done in heart rate Z1/2 /// 50-75% of threshold /// RPE 2-5. You should keep the effort level below threshold (heart rate Z4, 100% of threshold, RPE 7-8) during the max cadence efforts.\n\n\u200b\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- To improve stillness and stability at high cadences.\n- To improve muscle fiber engagement for improved efficiency at all cadences.\n- To increase maximum cadence.\n- To make that pedal stroke as smooth as butter.\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n- Single Leg: 85rpm\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 8 minutes @ RPE 23 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Interval**\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 5.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 7 --95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

In order to best execute this workout, you'll utilize a STATIONARY BIKE or TRAINER and a TREADMILL.\\* We recommend using a portable media device; smartphone or tablet, or placing your device where it can be seen from both pieces of equipment. Each bike set consists of 8-minutes of cycling and 4-minutes of running with 30-seconds in between for transitions. After each run, the transition back to the bike is a generous 90-seconds so you can recover just enough to repeat the next block at high intensity.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince this is a No-Vid, you'll have to pay attention to the screen for instructions. Be ready to begin on the treadmill with a short run warmup, then a short bike warmup, which will then take you right into the first bike set of 8-minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe bike sets are set at the normal 4DP values. For the running sets, the number in the power box won't mean anything, so just use the HR zones and RPE metrics for guidance on running intensity. After the 4th run set, you'll stay on the treadmill to cool down with an easy jog/walk.\n\n\\*DON\u2019T HAVE A TREADMILL? It\u2019s not optimal, but you can still use this video by running outside for four minutes.

You would be right. That's why we would never do something as crazy as letting you start the 2nd set from _The Shovel \\_fresh. Instead, you get to be the Nail for the first 3 efforts from \\_Nine Hammers_. Once you've done that and wrapped up that second set from _The Shovel_, all that stands between you and that massive pit of exhaustion and GLORY are 2 more Hammers. Did we mention they were Hammers 8 and 9? No? Good, good. Forget we said anything. Just pretend you have 3 Hammers and 1 Shovel to contend with. Those last 2 Hammers are \"Future You's\" problem - let that chump deal with the nightmare.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen asking, \"will this make me faster?\" the answer is YES (and, at least in the short term, quite miserable). _The Shovel_ packs a massive Anaerobic Capacity (AC) punch, with inverse-micro intervals that dish out ever higher the power the shorter the interval. While_ Nine Hammers_ packs a huge MAP/FTP punch, it also helps drive up your sustained power regardless of your rider type or weakness. Facing the first 3 hammers gives your aerobic (MAP/FTP) system a hefty load to deal with and will just about fully deplete your AC stores, which makes this the perfect time to start the 2nd set from _The Shovel_. With depleted reserves, starting with the short 5 second sprints ensures that you are just fresh enough to push your NM system but fatigued enough that your AC never fully recovers for the duration of these intervals. With your AC depleted, heart rate pegged, and breathing rate through the roof, the last thing you WANT is the final 2 hammers. This isn't about what you want, though. It's about what you need.\n\n\u200b\n\nBy the time you start this set of hammers, your top-end power will be feeling completely drained; any \"snap\" you might usually rely on to make it through these 3-4 minute efforts will be long gone. That means you are facing down the final 2 hammers relying solely on your MAP and FTP. The higher your FTP, the faster you will recover, and the higher your MAP, the greater the punishment you can handle. Once you pick yourself up off the floor from hammers 8 and 9, you will have pushed your body to its absolute limits across almost every 4DP Metric, which will send you down the path to be a faster and more badass Sufferlandrian.\n",

When it's your turn on the front, you will be well over your FTP, and while those pulls usually only last around 30 seconds, you'll clock almost 20 pulls over the course of 48k.\n\n\nPhysiologically speaking, a TTT is one of the best combined AC/MAP/FTP sessions out there. Regardless of your chosen discipline, Rider Type, or rider weakness, this effort will push you to your limits, and you'll be faster for it.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe original inspiration for our ProRides series, Team Scream just has that bit of...how do we say..._Sufferlandrian-ness_...to make it extra special.\n",

Over the next 45 minutes, you will complete four 30-second cadence builds, and six 60-second high cadence holds. This workout places a considerable demand on your Neuromuscular System, as your muscles are forced to contract and relax as quickly as possible. At the same time, the shorter recovery period between these drills will keep your heart rate, and breathing rate elevated, giving you a great cardiovascular workload.\n\nLet's breakdown the two drills you will be doing.\n\nCadence Builds: The name of the game here is absolute peak cadence, not peak power. To achieve this, you need to be in a small gear and have very light resistance. Starting at 90-RPM, steadily increase your cadence until you reach your absolute max with about 5-seconds left, and hold that to the end. Your limiting factor on these efforts needs to be leg speed. If resistance/power output is your limiting factor, try starting in an easier gear, or shift into an easier gear 15-seconds in. Bouncing in the saddle is okay for this drill.\n\nCadence Holds: These efforts require you to maintain the highest cadence you can without starting to bounce in the saddle. For some of you that will be 100-RPM, for others, it will be 150-RPM. The key is to settle into YOUR peak sustainable cadence. Like the Builds, the goal here is not high power, so these efforts are limited to 90% of FTP. Do not be surprised if your heart rate is well into Zone 4 by the time you hit the last few holds.\n\nTo properly execute this session, your effort between drills needs to be low. With limited recovery time between these maximal Neuromuscular Efforts, riding above Zone 1 between efforts will only reduce your ability to max out your cadence. While the power targets between are Zone 1, do not be surprised if your heart rate does not drop below Zone 2 after the first couple builds.\n\nWORKOUT GOALS:\n\n- Improved muscle recruitment and firing patterns\n- Improved muscle coordination at higher cadences\n- Deliver a high Neuromuscular and Cardiovascular load while minimizing the power demands placed on your muscles\n- Help you develop a silky smooth pedal stroke\n\nCADENCE TARGETS:\n\n- Warm-up 80-90rpm\n- Build: 90-150rpm\n- Hold: 115rpm\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n6 minutes @ RPE32 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **Number of Sets: 2, each unique\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: N/A\n\n**Set 1: x4**\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 5.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 7 --95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n5 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Set 2: x6**\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Your bodies ability to clear out metabolites and process oxygen is nearly identical between 90% of FTP and 100% of FTP, the difference is that at 100% of FTP your body is producing those metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. At 90% of FTP your body can clear things at the same rate, but your body isn't producing them at the same rate.\n\n\nLong Sub-Threshold efforts represent an effort that your body can just about handle (assuming you are properly fueled and not completely exhausted), clearing things out faster than they can accumulate. To really stress that clearance rate each of these Sub-Threshold efforts start with a 20-second effort well above FTP. By the time you settle into the Sub-Threshold effort, your body will be flooded with those metabolites that cause your legs and lungs to burn. However, since you are below FTP (clearing things out faster than you are producing them), the concentration of those metabolites will slowly drop over the course of the whole effort. Not only does this train your body to clear things faster, but it will also mentally prepare for the discomfort associated with efforts above FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor this session, we are asking you to dance on that razor's edge of your FTP, ideally the side that allows you to complete the session. If your legs or lungs aren't feeling great, you are better off dropping the steady effort by 5% and keeping the starting effort at 100%.\nAnother component of this is settling into a good rhythm of breathing and pedaling. Everyone has a preferred cadence, and this is an instance where your preferred cadence supersedes the cadence targets onscreen. We want you dancing right on that edge of your comfort, and you can get much closer to that edge riding your preferred cadence.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\"\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200b\n\nSounds simple right? It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Even though these efforts are under FTP, the high leg speed required will leave your system working harder than usual for the required power output.\n\n\nBy maintaining the highest cadence possible (without bouncing in the saddle) you end up pushing your neuromuscular coordination near its limits in a similar way to Cadence Builds.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith an emphasis on low torque (high RPM) efforts this session is polar opposite to sessions like GOAT and Power Station. Even though these efforts are short and below FTP the high cadence places more of a load on your cardiovascular system, so expect your heart rate and breathing to be higher than normal for the power.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince muscles can only contract (pull) any given muscle will primarily move a joint in a single direction. When it comes to pedaling a bike, your quads and glutes can push the pedals down, while your hamstrings and hip flexors pull the pedals back up (with the help of your glutes and quads on the other leg). If you were to pedal with one leg (as you do in Cadence Drills) and your hamstrings and glutes were unable to contract, once you get to the bottom of the pedal stroke your leg would be stuck down there. No matter how hard you might try, your glutes and quads will do nothing to help you get that pedal all the way around. Suppose you do have both feet clipped in, and you are letting your opposite leg push down to bring your leg back up to 12 o'clock. If your quads and glutes are still contracting (pushing the pedal down) while the glutes and quads of your other leg are starting to push their pedal down, you will end up with one leg working against the other. You must relax the glutes and quads of one leg to get all of the power out of the glutes and quads of your other leg.\n\nThis is where neuromuscular coordination comes into play. During each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d almost all of the muscles in your legs. By maintaining your highest cadence without bouncing, you are pushing all of the muscles in each leg to contract and relax (switch on and off) as quickly as possible.\n\n\nWhile we give specific cadence targets in this session, everyone has a different limit to what cadence they can maintain before bouncing in the saddle. To get the intended benefit of this session you need to maintain the power targets at the highest cadence that YOU can maintain. For some that might be 105RPM, for others, it might be 150RPM. What matters is that you push YOUR neuromuscular system to its limits.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 7 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

                    "body": "This session is all about high-torque efforts, very similar to the efforts you would experience riding up the steep slopes of Mt Sufferlandria. While these efforts are short and the intensity isn\u2019t too high, the low cadence targets combined with minimal recovery will leave some begging for the high-cadence sprints of _The Omnium_. High-torque efforts like these have two primary benefits: improved neuromuscular coordination and increased muscular endurance.\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d almost all of the muscles in your legs. High-cadence efforts in something like _Cadence Builds_ are great for teaching these groups to make that switch quickly. These low-cadence efforts are better for teaching ALL of the muscles in your legs to \u201cswitch on.\u201d Done properly, you should be pulling with your hamstrings with one leg while the other leg is pushing down with all the force your glutes and quads can muster. If you feel like you are pushing yourself up out of the saddle during harder efforts (like seated sprints), your hamstrings are not being utilized since they should pull you back down into your saddle.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe second main benefit is improved muscular endurance. Even though the session is under 45 minutes, **you'll put a similar amount of muscular fatigue into your legs as a steady, multi-hour base ride.** You can almost view this session as hitting the leg press for 8 sets of 100 reps. And just like the weight room, proper form is absolutely key. That means:\n\n- You should focus on pushing down AND pulling back up. You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up.\n- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o\u2019clock to 10 o\u2019clock.\n- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out.\n- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.\n\nThis session is very similar to _Power Station_. Both help improve your muscular endurance and coordination; the biggest difference is the work to rest ratio between the two. While the intervals here are shorter than those in _Power Station_, the decreased recovery duration means fatigue will build faster, especially for those with a weakness in repeated efforts.\n\nModifying interval length and recovery duration can also be seen between sessions like _Revolver_ and _A Very Dark Place_. Both serve up a healthy dose of MAP/VO2 work, but the overall feeling of those two sessions is different.\n\nIf you find that your lower back starts to ache during this session or that you have to start rocking in the saddle to keep the power up, then it\u2019s time for you to get started on the SYSTM Yoga program. Kick it off with \u201cCore Strengtheners \u201d to make sure your core is just as strong as those legs.\n",

The difference is that the overall stress on your system when riding tempo is considerably less than riding at FTP. That means you can either have harder days before or after a tempo session (compared to a Threshold session) or you can increase the duration of those tempo efforts to make the overall training stimulus equal (or greater) than completing several repeats right at your FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis tempo effort is divided into 3 segments of equal duration. While the power is the same across all segments, your target cadence starts and low and increases with each new segment. Starting with a long block of low cadence should fatigue your muscles from the start of your effort. As the effort builds and you create more fatigue, the increased cadence targets will place a greater demand on your cardiovascular system. That will, in some way, feel like a nice break given the load you have been putting on your muscular system. The cadence targets in the final segment will force your fatigued muscles to maintain good coordination as the faster cadence requires your muscles to switch \"on\" and \"off\" at a faster rate. Between the low rpm sections, and the high rpm work under fatigue, this tempo session not only helps train your FTP, but it has a training benefit to your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou can expect your Heart Rate to remain low for the power targets during the low cadence segment at the start. As the effort progresses and you reach the final 10 minutes of the high rpm segment your heart rate might go over Z3, which is not something to worry about. While this session appears \"easy\" at first glance, don't be surprised if your legs are feeling it the next day.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\nBuild 1: 25 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\nBuild 2: 25 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\nBuild 3: 25 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200b\n\nWe promised you full body strength development, and this routine delivers. In fact, more than a third of this workout is dedicated to the muscles above the hips. That means you'll complete nearly 20 minutes of core and upper body work by the time you\u2019re done. In the same way, it takes time for you to build up to riding 100 miles, it takes time to build up to this amount of strength endurance work. Without following the proper progression, the difficulty and duration of the core work here would leave you sore for days after. But if you\u2019re ready for it, and in the context of the proper progression, this workout will be doable but definitely challenging.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

The goal of this session is to accumulate a significant amount of time near your VO2max, or the point at which your body is consuming as much oxygen as it possibly can. That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of each interval, especially in the final few intervals.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be tapping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. To account for this, we have limited the recovery duration to be equal to the interval duration. Limited recovery ensures that you will drain your Anaerobic Capacity before the end of the intervals, meaning your body will be forced to produce as much power as possible using oxygen. Pushing your aerobic system to its max like this is not just great for improving MAP, but also your FTP. Since MAP limits your FTP, improving your MAP is vital to the continued growth of your FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nBy the end of this session, you will have accumulated 20-minutes near your Maximal Aerobic Power, which will leave your legs aching and your lungs burning.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n5minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort** x10\n\nWork: 2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRest: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n50 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

Together, this will hit your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) hard, all while helping boost your FTP since the recovery periods are so short. It's the perfect session to help you break up a block of steady FTP training or to prepare for a criterium, track race, draft legal triathlon, or cyclocross race. Because the targets are all well above FTP, it\u2019s best to come into this session relatively well-rested and motivated.\n",

The first set of sprints has enough recovery that you'll be able to work your NM to the max. The second set still has enough recovery to allow you to hit high power numbers, but the reduced time between sprints stresses your ability to recover and repeat that high effort. That means you'll start to dip into AC. The last set\u2014with equal sprint and recovery times\u2014ensures your heart rate never gets a chance to drop down. That works your MAP like nobody's business.\n",

Those sessions hit you with short efforts well above FTP, followed by longer efforts moderately below FTP.\nThe concept is simple: you alternate blocks of time just below your FTP, with equal duration blocks just above your FTP. For this session, each interval is 8-minutes in length, with 1-minute blocks at 95% of FTP (Under) and 1-minute blocks at 105% of FTP (Over).\n\n\nThe real training benefit comes from that time spent just below FTP trying to \"Recover.\" Physiologically, you train your body to be more efficient when working just below FTP. Mentally, it shows you that you can still \"recover\" (or at least hold on for dear life) as long as you are riding just a little below your FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n1 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP-- HR <80%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n3 minutes 15 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

No need for FTP here, friends. It's the perfect session to improve top-end power without having to do a ton of repetitive efforts.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Scratch Race and Flying Lap have an easy enough lead-in that you get to put your max sprint to the full test. Add in the standing starts for the Individual Pursuit and Kilo, and you give your NM a real run-through. The repeated surges of the Elimination Race, the all-out nature of the Kilo, and the massive efforts you have to make in the points race really test your powers of recovery while working your AC all the way to the max.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince the efforts come in quick succession, and with most being over four minutes in length, your cardiovascular system never catches a real break, ensuring your MAP doesn\u2019t get left out of the equation.\n",

We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \"Negative-Split\", meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \"easier\" tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session contains a single 60-minute tempo effort, broken into three 20-minute segments. You will spend the first 20-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 20 at 84%, and the final 20 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200b\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \"wake up call\" on any poor training habits you might have so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: NA\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100\n\n20 minutes@ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The session is based on a combination of specific micro-intervals (made famous by Japanese coach and physiologist Izumi Tabata) that we combined with classic tempo efforts. This gives you a superb mix of Anaerobic Capacity (AC), Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and FTP training stresses in one short workout to help you go faster and stay stronger for longer.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow, for the sports science purists among you, the 'Tabata' intervals should actually be named 'Koichi' intervals, since it was Japanese speedskating coach Irisawa Koichi who first employed the use of the 20-seconds on / 10-seconds off intervals that Dr. Izumi then confirmed via physiology lab studies to yield the best mix of maximal aerobic and anaerobic stress among the different on/off protocols that he tested.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor this workout, we have toned down the original intensity of the Tabata intervals to target MAP rather than Anaerobic Capacity in order to be able to complete the 20/10 micro-intervals and then follow the short efforts immediately with sustained 80-100% of FTP intervals to replicate the kind of attack and then settle efforts that are common in cycling races.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom a physiological perspective, you\u2019ll produce lots of lactate during the micro-intervals. Then the goal of the tempo and FTP efforts is to stress your body\u2019s capacity to clear that lactate as quickly as possible. Effectively, we\u2019re trying to maximize lactate 'flux.' For each successive round of the efforts, you\u2019ll do one less micro-interval, and the tempo efforts will get shorter. But because you\u2019re a Sufferlandrian, they won\u2019t get easier, and the rest between sets will get shorter. The intensity for the tempo efforts will ramp up with each repetition. Fortunately for you, there are only 3 sets of efforts and you\u2019ll be done in just 30 minutes. If you\u2019ve set aside an hour for this workout, you\u2019ll be happy to have those additional 30 minutes for recovery after this session.\n",

Well, it's repeated 20-minute blocks at an effort 5-10% below your FTP. In this case, you are looking at three 20-minute blocks at 90% of your FTP, and effort we refer to as \"Sub-Threshold\".\n\n\nMany refer to this intensity as \"Sweet-Spot\", but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power wonder above FTP. The idea behind and Sub-Threshold is to hold an effort just below FTP. This ensures your effort remains at a workout rate you know your body can handle, but an effort that is quite close to an effort you would not be able to handle.\n\n\nThe only way you are going to make it through three of these 20-minute efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5-minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Do NOT be that person. 99 times out a 100, that person blows up in the second interval, and never even makes to the last 10-minutes. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \"bite\" towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady state efforts. Whether that is a Time Trial, local Climb, breakaway, Triathlon, or even a good old Power Test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key, seeing how your RPE can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged.\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right?\n\n\nAs we said, the first 5-minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your LTHR. If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren't going hard enough.\nIf you have never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 of each effort. There is no shame in building up to this full session, so don't be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body, and understanding what that edge feels like, between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort.\n\n\nThat means failing this workout is fairly common, and not at all something to get down about. As long as you learn your lesson, like what \"too hard\" feels like 10-minutes in, then you have bettered your riding ability, even if this workout itself was not executed successfully.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n12 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The 2 things that make this session stand out are:\n\n1. You only have one single continuous effort (which happens to be 60-minutes in length)\n2. Your recovery power is low Tempo, which is good because any higher than that and you wouldn't last the full 60 minutes!\n\nAs you increase intensity from 80% of FTP up to 100% of FTP, your legs begin to produce more and more metabolites, but the rate at which your body CAN clear them is almost the same. As you close in on 100% of FTP you suddenly are at a point where production of metabolites equals your clearance rate. Now move just a bit over FTP and those metabolites are going to continue to build until you drop your effort back below FTP.\n\n\nTo improve your bodies clearance rate for those metabolites, you need to spend a decent amount of time with more of those metabolites in your system than your bodies current clearance rate can handle.\n\n\nThat is what this session is all about, short hard efforts above FTP to build an excess of metabolites, followed by steady riding at 80% of FTP. This steady-state effort between surges is high enough that your body will still be working at max clearance rates but low enough that you can keep doing those surges over and over again, which is good for you because this is not a short interval.\n\n\nWhile you can achieve the same training stimuli by holding shorter blocks above FTP, those sessions have their drawbacks. The main one is nailing the exact right intensity above FTP that will allow you to accumulate enough time in that metabolite flooded state. While we like to think our FTP is set in stone, the reality is it can fluctuate from day to day, which makes finding that balancing point for a session like that so difficult. You can easily go too hard and blow up early, or not go hard enough and never really push that clearance rate to the max. By hitting surges well above FTP, then holding an effort a good deal below FTP, any day to day variation in your FTP becomes less of an issue because you never have to dance 5W above or below it.\n\n\nThe added benefit to this Surge and Settle workout style is the boost it can give to your Anaerobic Capacity. An improved AC means you can recover faster, not just from sprint type efforts, but from repeated MAP and FTP efforts as well.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n40 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 12\n\nRest between sets: 4 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n1 hour 35 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

While it's not as comprehensive or as accurate as our main fitness test, _Full Frontal_, it's far more approachable and easier to pace for new riders. It also doesn't require any special preparation. You just need to feel relatively fresh.\n\n\u200b\n\nBased on more than a year of research (and after dozens of lab tests and thousands of online tests) and using sophisticated analysis of power and heart rate data, _Half Monty_ is far more accurate and comprehensive than standard ramp tests.\n\n\u200b\n\nIt also tells you more about who you are as an athlete. _Half Monty_ provides you with your FTP, Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and Cycling Threshold Heart Rate (cTHR), all of which we use to personalize your workout targets.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf you're still using the 4DP estimates when you set up your account, _Half Monty_ will also refine your AC and NM estimates (but will not do so if you've done _Full Frontal_ or manually adjusted your estimates). If you want fully accurate AC and NM, as well as your Rider Type, Strengths, Weaknesses, and training plans adjusted to those Strengths and Weaknesses, you'll need to expose yourself to the _Full Frontal_ 4DP fitness test.\n\n\u200b\n\nReady to climb the ramp? You'll need the following before you start:\n\n- A heart rate monitor if you want the most accurate results. Don't have one? Order one [HERE](https://wahoofitness.com/devices)\n- Some kind of power device connected (trainer, power meter, virtual power, etc.)\n- Be ready to pay close attention to the instructions in the workout\n- Be sure your profile is complete and up-to-date (Profile > About You). Accurate information helps us make our calculations\n\n[Here's some more information on how to get the most from your fitness test.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterFitnessAssessment)\n",

Although it has minimal Suffering in it, _Elements of Style_ may just be our most important session ever.  \n  \nDeveloped together with the team at CyclingTips and shot on location in Wanaka, New Zealand, this workout provides the  foundation for building power and speed. Over the course of six specific drills, you'll learn and practice:  \n  \n- An exclusive 9-point 'Systems Check' you can use on any ride to get into your optimal position.  \n- A 4-step process for standing up on a climb and generating more power. How to engage your core, including your glutes, for more stability and power.  \n- The components of a smooth pedal stroke and how to bring them together at both low and high cadences.  \n- How to stay relaxed and efficient under pressure.  \n  \nNarrated by one of the best cycling commentators in the world, Eurosport's Carlton Kirby, you'll get clear instructions about exactly what to do, when, and why. We guarantee it will change the way you think about your riding style after doing it just once. Do it five times, and you'll automatically adjust your position while out on rides. Do it 10 times, and Sufferlandrian Angels will burst into tears at the sheer epic beauty of you kicking the crap out of your competition while making it look oh so effortless.  \n",

Instead, it's intended to be used as you begin tapering for an event or test day. While the 3-minute MAP efforts are by no means easy, there are only 3 efforts, with nice long 7-minute recoveries between them. What that means is you will be close to fully recovered at the start of each MAP effort.\n\nUnless you have a substantial VO2 weakness, this session won't do much to help improve your MAP. It will, however, help you maintain your current level. There is just enough sting in this workout to get your system working near its max, but not enough time near your max to add much fatigue. Regardless of what event you are targeting (with the exception of a flying 200m or Kilo on the track) this should be one of your go-to sessions in the final 10 days of your preparation since it primes your cardiovascular system to help you produce power with oxygen more effectively.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile ERG mode is great for many workouts, this is one that you might want to run in Level mode, especially if your training has been going well or your Full Frontal results are more than 2 months old. The benefit of this session comes from your body just about hitting its max for the final 10-30 seconds of each effort. Follow the targets set for the first 3-minute interval, and then make any necessary changes to the intensity for the final two.\n\n\u200b\n\nEven though there are cadence targets for each section, you should aim for the same cadence you would hold during the 5-minute test in Full Frontal. The goal is to strike a balance between your cardiovascular system and your muscular system. If your cadence is too low, you will be putting too much stress on your muscular system. Too high and you will be pushing your cardiovascular system more than necessary. If you are relatively fresh, this is how you should feel by the end of each effort:\n\n1. Your heart rate should be above your LTHR.\n2. Your breathing rate should be near its max.\n3. Your legs should be hurting.\n\nThat said, you shouldn't feel like you are turning yourself inside out to make it through the final 30 seconds. Save that feeling for Nine Hammers.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nWork: 3 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRest: 7 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

For this workout, you will complete a series of 6-minute efforts. The first 4-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn't so tough in itself, but the final 2-minutes of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen we talk about a \"negative split\" we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice an high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 6-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \"feeling\" how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 12-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC. Making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC, but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort** x2\n\nNumber of sets:\n\nRest between sets: 30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 3\n\n**Interval **\n\nEffort 1: 4 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\nEffort 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%%\n\nRest: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n50 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you'll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you've made off the bike.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathalons) you should complete this sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\n\u200b\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don't feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence. Now get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 18\nRest between sets: 9 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- >105%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Originally created in Coach Sir Neal Henderson's Penn State dorm room in 1992, it's his weapon of choice for bringing the pain (shakes).\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat's in the Blender? First, a variety of longer efforts build sustained power while also making sure you're sufficiently fatigued. This initial beatdown is necessary to ensure you get the maximum benefit from _Blender_'s infamous 'Pain Shakes.' Three sets of these little devils help you develop a supernatural ability to recover from big efforts. The bonus is that you also beef up your ability to produce high-end power, building Anaerobic Capacity and Maximal Aerobic Power simultaneously.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe threshold efforts at the end are the bitter cherry on the sundae, improving your body's ability to produce aerobic power and helping make sure your FTP will get the same boost as your AC and MAP. A rising tide of lactic acid raises all boats. Oh, and clocking in at one hour and 40 minutes, Blender will also help whip your endurance into a frenzy.\n",

To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery. These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. **Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort.** To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe understand that not everyone's trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can't safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201cnormal\u201d all-out sprints.\n",

But it's gone on too long and we had to respond. So, over a bottle of Real Pagne, legendary Directeur Sportif Grunter von Agony had a quiet word with a man named Ian Field. You may know that Ian is an elite coach with Dig Deep Coaching and a four-time British National Cyclocross National Champion. After an evil laugh that lingered, he provided us with a workout he uses to perform at the highest levels of the Cyclocross World Cup. 'Don't worry,' said Ian. 'The Couchlandrians will enjoy half of it.'\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is a fantastic session for improving Anaerobic Capacity (AC). The short, high-intensity efforts with equally short recoveries stress your body's ability to recover quickly. In fact, the recoveries are short enough that you never really get a \u201cfull recovery\u201d during a set. This means your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) is developed in the latter half of both sets as fatigue sets in. It's also worth mentioning that because of the short durations, you do tap into your Neuromuscular Power (NM) at the start of each effort.\n",

In the mid 90's Professor Izumi Tabata set out to study the training impact of HIIT compared to a more traditional lower intensity high volume training. While both groups saw a similar increase in VO2max, only the HIIT group improved their Anaerobic Capacity, which is often associated with an increased ability to repeat hard efforts.\n\n\nThe HIIT protocol that Professor Izumi Tabata used was 4-minute blocks broken into what we refer to as \"Micro-Intervals\" 20sec efforts well above VO2max power (similar to what we refer to as MAP) and 10 seconds of recovery.\nThis was one of the first widely recognized studies that promoted HIIT, and since HIIT is The Sufferfest's Specialty, we would be crazy not to include this session.\n\n\nDuring this session, you are looking at 3 sets of Micro-Intervals in 5-minute blocks, with each 20sec power target exceeding 100% of your MAP. While the targets we have set are slightly lower than Tabata's original study, those subjects only completed one 4-minute block of their high-intensity session, and you get to complete 3 of them! That means if you finish the first set feeling fine, increase MAP intensity by 5%, or just switch to slope mode and get back to using RPE; these are MAX intervals after all, so just give it what you've got!\n\n\nThis session really does pack a punch, and being mentally prepared for it is more important than being physically prepared. By design, this session will completely drain your AC and max out your aerobic system. No one gets to that point and feels \"good.\" You need to mentally brace yourself to get into the hurt locker and stay down there until the bitter end.\n\n\nUncertain if you have that mental toughness or skill set to handle this session? Then check out the \"Getting Positive\" module on our Mental Toughness Program. While we encourage everyone to try MTP from start to finish (which takes about 10 weeks) just doing this one module can be incredibly beneficial.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 10\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

But there is more here than the power file shows. The lack of obvious intensity in these short intervals is made up for by the very low cadence targets each effort requires. This creates minimal cardiovascular stress but places a tremendous load on your muscular system. The goal is to keep your upper body absolutely rock solid during these efforts. If you find that you bob back and forth for each pedal stroke, then your core is not up to the task your legs are giving it (better get onto our yoga videos and strengthen that core).\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session can be a great test to see how your lower back will hold up over a longer ride outside. A core that will fail you after 3 hours of road riding can often be identified fairly quickly during this session. If your back is burning just as badly as your legs, it's a signal to do some additional core strengthening. With so much stress on your muscles, this is a great session for improving your overall endurance and your ability to produce lots of high torque, giving your Neuromuscular Power a nice boost along the way.\n",

This requires you to finesse your output multiple times for each effort to really feel the difference 10 watts makes.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe stair-step approach also forces your body into a constant state of \u201ccatching up.\u201d Just as your aerobic system settles into the oxygen demands of each effort, you're forced to go harder, which makes you dip back into anaerobic energy systems while your aerobic system catches up. This process constantly forces your anaerobic and aerobic systems to make adjustments. If you're trying to get over a plateau or feel like you're not getting faster, this can be exactly what you need.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnlike other sessions, three of the four sprint efforts come in the first half. This means your legs will be fresh enough so you can go full gas and hit your Neuromuscular (NM) system hard. Not bad for a session that is predominantly focused on building your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) and Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP).\n",

The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you'll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you complete off the bike strength work you want your on bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you've made off the bike.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons) you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aerobars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\n\u200b\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don't feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence. Now get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 10\n\nRest between sets: 5 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- >105%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The term \"Taper\" refers to how you train in the week or so before your target event to ensure you deliver your best performance. Generally, tapering means reducing your total training volume but continuing to hit some high-intensity efforts. While there are individual variations in the best way to taper, this session has been used by countless professionals leading into the biggest races of their lives -- athletes like World Champions Rohan Dennis and Flora Duffy.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith 3 sets of micro-intervals (40/20s, 30/30s, and 20/40s) you will hit your system with just enough intensity to keep your legs sharp and responsive, without adding any real fatigue. Outside of those 3 sets of micro-intervals, this session is purposefully short and easy. This is a preparation session, not a training session! After all, your event is just around the corner and all of the important training is behind you. Riding harder or longer today will do absolutely nothing to increase your fitness by event day; in fact, all that would do is increase your fatigue, which will only hurt your performance. Rather, this session makes sure your body is humming along and ready to perform on the big day.\n",

Our Full Body Strength series is exactly what you\u2019re after, offering a well-rounded series of exercises that covers the lower body, core, posterior chain, and upper body. With a substantial progression, there\u2019s enough here to keep you busy -- and improving -- for a very long time._\n\n\u200b\n\nWith 30 minutes of work and an exciting array of 26 exercises, this is a solid workout. While we still run you through the paces on lower body moves, this session will hit your upper body and core quite hard. This ensures that you continue to build full-body strength and stability. Since, by now, you are ninja-level competent on every move (and since you only get gains when you give your body new training loads) we're going to push you by increasing the total number of reps across all the exercises. Get in there!\n\n\u200b\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

Your body's ability to clear metabolites and process oxygen doesn't really change at 90% of FTP and above. What that means it that whether you are at 90% or 100% of FTP your body is clearing those things out at the same rate. It's just that at FTP your body is producing more of those metabolites that it is capable of clearing.\n\n\u200b\n\nBy surging above FTP you are creating metabolites faster than your body can clear them. If you were to settle into 100% of FTP, you would only be clearing things out at the rate you are producing them. That means whatever you have produced from that surge will just stay there. By dropping just below FTP your body is clearing things out faster than you are producing them. That means that the excess you got from that surge will slowly be cleared out.\n\n\u200b\n\nEach a surge pops up during this workout, your body should have just about cleared what was made from the last surge. Not only does this push your body's ability to clear these things to the max, but it also teaches your mind to deal with the discomfort of burning lungs and legs associated with these efforts at or above threshold.\n\n\u200b\n\nA simpler way to think of this is that you are teaching your body and mind to \"recover\" just below FTP. Not only does this help bump up your FTP, but it also helps you recover that much faster anytime you let off the gas, whether for a downhill, turn, or finding a good draft. Having the confidence that you can recover while feeling so uncomfortable can mean the difference between hanging onto to a new personal best and completely throwing in the towel.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is the perfect session to practice your positive thinking from the Mental Toughness Program (If you haven't checked that out already you definitely should!).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 4\n\n**Interval **\n\nWork: 30 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

But it also helps out your AC. Since your AC has already been stressed from the intervals at the beginning, this section boosts your AC more in this context than it would if you just did _The Rookie_.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe final climb from _Angels_ is almost entirely above threshold.

The 40-second efforts are followed by (all too) short 20-second 'recoveries' -- together, these deplete your tank and teach your body how to make repeated high-intensity efforts.

After years of lobbying, we finally convinced Grunter von Agony to share his favorite set of implements with us: the fabled _14 Vise Grips_. Taken individually, each of the 14 intervals might appear tame, incapable of inflicting a significant squeeze. But when expertly applied in the correct order, they apply just the right kind of pressure to turn a Couchlandrian into a Sufferlandrian, just like turning coal into diamonds.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile the duration of each Vise Grip varies (from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), the power targets and recovery durations between them remain constant. The first 30-second interval should feel like a Sunday stroll in the park, but by the end of the first 2-minute Vise Grip, you'll be cursing Grunter's name. As the intervals get shorter, time will appear to stretch. That final 30-second effort will feel like an eternity. When you roll up to the second set, you'll know what you're in for, so just put your head down and prepare yourself to crush or be crushed.\n\n\u200b\n\nOnce you make it through all 14 Vise Grips, you will have been north of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) for a total of 16 minutes. Changing the duration of the efforts (while keeping the same recovery) stresses your Anaerobic Capacity (AC) in a more dynamic way than, say, a more straightforward on/off session like _Half is Easy_. Since the longer efforts have the same recovery duration as the shorter ones, you will eventually deplete your AC, forcing your body to rely on your MAP to hit the required power targets. As the intervals get shorter in the second half of each set, you'll find that you have just enough left in the tank to complete the next effort.\n\n\u200b\n\nUltimately this workout combines the advantages of shorter, higher-power intervals with longer recovery (great for building muscular strength) with the advantages of longer, higher-power intervals with inadequate recovery (great for driving up your MAP and improving your AC).\n",

Additionally, this routine will place greater demands on your upper body and core than any previous session has. Not only do you have 10+ minutes dedicated to the muscles above your hips, but the progression of High Planks and High Side Planks means that even the \u201ccore-work\u201d moves have a difficult upper-body component. We\u2019re also going to ask a lot of your movement stabilization muscles -- it\u2019s about time they were held to account.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

On the plus side, all of the efforts are 15-seconds shorter than those in The Trick. To make up for this, we added two more intervals to this session, bringing the total to 6. That means by the end of this session you will have plowed through 4.5-minutes of AC work.\n\n\nThis workout is one of the few sessions that we do NOT recommend you complete in ERG mode if you are on a smart trainer. The goal is to hold onto the highest power you can for the full 45-seconds. Inevitably in the later sets, your power will dip before you reach the end of the interval. What we want is for you to complete every effort having given everything for 45-seconds. We don't want ERG mode grinding you to a halt because you cannot maintain the (ridiculously) high power targets. Even if you drop down below FTP in the final 10-seconds of these efforts, as long as you are going flat out, you are doing it correctly.\n\nJust take this session one interval at a time, and focus on giving your all for this one effort. You can worry about the others when you get to them.

With this fatigue, the three-minute efforts above threshold will get your cardiovascular system working near its max - the exact stress needed to pump up your MAP.

Why? Going above threshold causes a considerable amount of hormonal stress that takes a lot of time to recover from. But you don\u2019t actually have to ride above threshold to improve your FTP. The difference in fitness gains between 30 minutes at 90% of threshold and at 102% of threshold is minimal. Still, the stress on your body from the latter is much greater, and the recovery much longer.\n\n\u200b\n\nThat's why this session is a key component to any training plan: It gives you enough training stress to help improve your FTP but remains 'easy' enough that you can do it when you're tired or before a big block of harder efforts.\n",

This workout features 3 sets of intervals. Each set combines a series of 40-second efforts with 20-second recoveries, followed by an immediate transition to a sustained effort just below threshold. These short efforts with minimal recovery deplete your anaerobic gas tank, forcing your body to get better at producing power aerobically. This combination will help improve your Anaerobic Capacity, (AC) your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), and your Functional Threshold Power (FTP), all in just under an hour.\n\n\u200b\n\nAt the start of each set, your body starts to dip into your anaerobic reserves to help hit the high-power targets. Your body then starts to ramp up your oxygen intake in order to produce more of the power requirements aerobically. With such short recovery time between these efforts, your AC is steadily drained through each set. By the time the last short interval arrives, your body will be forced to produce almost all of that power aerobically, which will push your lungs to their very limit.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is the optimal time to stress your body\u2019s ability to produce power at threshold. With your AC depleted (and your lungs and heart working near maximal capacity), the shorter sustained efforts that would normally be a piece of cake will have a bit more...sting. No matter what your preferred discipline, terrain, or distance, this session will make you fitter and faster.\n\n\u200b\n\nFeaturing exciting, on-bike camera footage from the Velon Hammer Series, _The Chores_ will make you earn your keep.\n",

However, that accumulated time is split up over two sets of 5 efforts, each 2-minutes in length. The goal of this session is to accumulate a significant amount of time near VO2max, or the point at which your body is consuming as much oxygen as it possibly can. That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of the 4th and 5th interval in each set.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be taping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. Limited recovery ensures that your Anaerobic Capacity is drained before the end of either set, forcing your body to produce as much power as possible aerobically. By splitting these efforts into two sets, you will be producing more power anaerobically compared to doing all ten intervals in a single set. While this means you accumulate less time near your VO2max, you will be able to hold a higher power for the final five intervals. Splitting the efforts will shift the training stress away from your cardiovascular system and onto your muscular system.\n\nUltimately this session will improve your ability to produce power aerobically in addition to improving your muscular strength and endurance, both of which are key to increasing your MAP and your FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n5minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 5\n\n**Interval**\n\nWork: 2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRest: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

The Starting effort should just about completely drain your Anaerobic Capacity, which will leave you gasping for air as you start each 40-second MAP effort. By forcing yourself to maintain MAP after a maximal sprint, you are asking your body to increase oxygen supply to your muscles as quickly as possible by increasing your heart rate and breathing rate. Being able to increase oxygen consumption rapidly means your body will better handle changes in pace both above and below threshold.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat you need to do:\n\n- You will need to begin each Standing Start at super low RPM's with very high torque (high resistance). To maximize muscle recruitment you want to both push-down and pull-up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must, as your legs need a sturdy backboard to push against.\n- You'll want the starting resistance to be just high enough that only your max effort can get the pedals moving; after those first few revs your goal is to get your cadence up as high as possible by the end of the 20 seconds. The best way to ensure you have the right resistance is to complete this session in slope mode rather than ERG mode.\n- Once the 20-second start is over you want to settle right into the 40-second effort at MAP, avoiding any significant drop in power at the transition point. Since the goal of this 40-second MAP effort is maximal cardiovascular demand, aim to hold your cadence 10-15 RPM higher than you would for the 5-minute test in Full Frontal.\n\nFor Time Trialists and Triathletes:\n\nAfter the Standing Start, you will want to get into your aerobars and hold the same position you will be competing in. Those on regular road bikes should get down into the drops.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n15 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 5\n\nRest between sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 95-105%% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nore is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.\n\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 5\n\nRest between sets: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval **\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n35 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

                    "body": "While you're certainly going to feel this workout in your legs, it's what happens in your head over these six intervals that matter most. A sort of 'Applied Mental Training Program' session is a unique addition to the SUF library.\n\n\u200b\n\nOver the course of the workout, you'll be taken through six different mental toughness tasks drawn from the SYSTM Mental Training Program (available here in the app). We'll teach you how to focus, use positive self-talk, and see an image of Future You to help you push through the Suffering.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom a physical point of view, this is a series of five-minute intervals with very high Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) efforts at both ends. They pack the same training punch as much longer Sub-Threshold efforts with the added bonus of stimulating your MAP and Anaerobic Capacity (AC) simultaneously.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Physiologically**:\nThe first 30-second effort digs you into an anaerobic hole. Even though it is a MAP-based target, your heart rate and breathing rates (and thus ability to deliver oxygen) are still low, so your body must produce much of this power anaerobically. By the time you settle into the 4-minutes at just below FTP, your body will have produced an excess of metabolites responsible for that burning in your legs. Only by riding below FTP will your body clear them out since FTP is the tipping point where your body produces metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. By holding you at FTP, your body cannot clear out that excess, forcing you to deal with the associated discomfort for the next 4-minutes.\n\nCapping the effort off with a final 30-second surge requires that you dig into what is left of your AC while your body pushes you close to your VO2 max, or the point at which your body is using as much oxygen as it possibly can. The net result is a session that is great for improving FTP, MAP, and AC, regardless of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Psychologically**:\nEach 4-minute segment at just below FTP will end up feeling harder than it should, given your body is forced to stew in whatever excess metabolites you produced in the first 30-seconds. While it will be unpleasant, you should find it never really gets MORE unpleasant. In addition to the benefits from the actual mental training exercises, this preps you to have confidence in your ability to hold longer sustained FTP efforts. The final surge then shows you that even when you feel uncomfortable for that long, your body still has something more to give. Going through the Mental Training techniques while you're pushing through the discomfort will only make you stronger out on the road.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn some cultures, the bat symbolizes the death of old ways and the rise of new ones. Time to burn those old, bad habits and build some new, positive ones.\n",

It's rare for Sir Neal to allow you so much recovery, but you'll deplete your Creatine Phosphate and muscle glycogen stores within these 30s efforts so it's crucial that your muscles have enough time to recover the necessary energy to repeat each successive interval with the same strength. By the end of this workout, you may feel as though you've done a heavy leg session in the gym, as this type of workout recruits primarily your Type II and Type IIb muscle fibers and leaves your slow-twitch fibers relatively fresh.  \n",

Not only is this a great workout physiologically, but it's also great for learning how to ride a negative split.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen we talk about a \"negative split\" we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. While the first few of these might not feel so bad, the repetition and 1:1 work to recovery will ensure your heart rate and breathing stay elevated for the second half.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \"feeling\" how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis dishes out a respectable 24-minutes of intensity. The fact that your heart and lungs are already pumping at high output when you start each MAP effort maximizes the gain you'll get from those 8-minutes at 100% of MAP.\n\n\u200b\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort** x8\n\nEffort 1: 2 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\nEffort 2: 1 minutes @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%%\n\nRest: 3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n",

The workout includes:\n\n- **Mobility exercises for the hips, mid-back, and shoulders** in order to activate muscles, increase range of motion, and prevent injury. For example, the shoulder internal rotation strengthens the high elbow catch position, while the shoulder external rotation strengthens the rotator cuff muscles and allows for proper movement of the arm overhead.  \n- **Kicking on your side** to maintain the strength and endurance needed to apply pressure to the water on both the downstroke and upstroke of the kick.  \n- **\u201cSwimming\u201d with a band.** Maintaining the specific muscle endurance required for swimming is exceptionally difficult without actually swimming, but performing the movement pattern, even without a band or one arm at a time, is a great way to maintain some of the muscle conditioning that you\u2019ve already developed.  \n- **Isometric exercises** increase neuromuscular activation and provide the muscles with more time under tension, or the amount of time that they\u2019re in the contracted state.  \n",

This one, however is a little less focused on Anaerobic Capacity and a little more on muscle endurance, due to that big blue block in the middle. The first pyramid will begin to fatigue your muscles and tax your AC before you face 20 minutes at tempo. With both of those efforts under your belt, the second pyramid will drain the rest of your AC and ask your aerobic system to pick up the slack. This might even feel similar to a mountain bike or cyclocross race effort- you take it out hard, jockeying for the hole shot or a front pack position before getting into the technical elements. Then you settle into a sustainable effort for a short while, maybe working with a couple others before battling it out for your final finishing position.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Build x3**\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n18 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: 20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100\n\nInterval repeats per set: 1\n\n**Interval **\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- >105%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n50 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 120% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n40 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- >105%\n\n7 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes 40 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70\n",

In the mid 90's Professor Izumi Tabata set out to study the training impact of HIIT compared to a more traditional lower intensity high volume training. While both groups saw a similar increase in VO2max, only the HIIT group improved their Anaerobic Capacity, which is often associated with an increased ability to repeat hard efforts.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe HIIT protocol that Professor Izumi Tabata used 4-minute blocks broken into what we refer to as \"Micro-Intervals\" 20sec efforts well above VO2max Power (similar to what we refer to as MAP) and 10 seconds of recovery.\nThis was one of the first widely recognized studies that promoted HIIT, and since HIIT is The Sufferfest's Specialty, we would be crazy not to include this session, which rounds out our series of Micro-Interval workouts, which already includes 40/20's and 20/10's.\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring this session, you are looking at 3 sets of Micro-Intervals in 11-minute blocks, with each 30sec power target at or just below 100% of your MAP.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session really does pack a punch, and being mentally prepared for it is more important than being physically prepared. By design, this session will completely drain your AC and max out your aerobic system. No one gets to that point and feels \"good.\" You need to mentally brace yourself to get into the hurt locker and stay down there until the bitter end.\n\n\u200b\n\nUncertain if you have that mental toughness or skill set to handle this session? Then check out the \"Getting Positive\" module on our Mental Toughness Program. While we encourage everyone to try MTP from start to finish (which takes about 10 weeks) just doing this one module can be incredibly beneficial.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute 45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: 15\n\n**Interval**\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

                    "body": "The 3x25-minute sub-threshold workout is one of the most classic interval sessions out there, so it felt natural to use the Queen of the Classics as the scene for this FTP-builder. The reason the 3x25 sub-threshold workout is so popular is that it is easy to follow, helps teach good pacing, and gives you a great threshold training stimulus.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn this case, you're looking at three, 25-minute blocks at around 90% of your FTP, an effort we refer to as \"Sub-Threshold\".\n\nMany refer to this intensity as \"Sweet-Spot\", but we prefer Sub-Threshold, as the real key is to never let your power creep above your FTP. Staying just below threshold ensures that your effort remains at an intensity you know your body can handle but that is close to what would not be sustainable.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe only way you're going to make it through three of these 25-minute efforts is if you pace yourself properly. Everyone feels just fine for the first 5 minutes of the first effort, and are often tempted to go harder. Don't be that person. More often than not, that person blows up spectacularly in the second interval, unable to finish the session. Or they have to ride that second interval at lower power, turning it into a Tempo session, which is not the goal.\n\n\u200b\n\nGetting a sense of how these efforts \"bite\" towards the end is vital to learning how to pace yourself over longer steady-state efforts; whether that's a time trial, local climb, breakaway, triathlon, or even a good old fitness test. In each of those cases, the pacing is key. Learning how your perceived effort can steadily climb even though your power remains unchanged is critical to good pacing.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo how do you know if you are doing this one right? As we said, the first 5 minutes should feel relatively easy. Around that 5-minute mark, your heart rate should stop climbing, and settle into 2-5% below your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR). If your heart rate is climbing for the entire effort and goes above your LTHR, then you are going too hard.\n\nIf you hit the 10-minute mark, your legs feel fine, and your heart rate is still in Zone 3, then you aren't going hard enough.\n\nIf you've never done a session like this before, you can consider only doing the first 20-minute effort, or even sticking to just the first 15 minutes of each effort. There's no shame in building up to this full session, so don't be afraid to pause and fast forward as needed.\n\n\u200b\n\nNailing this session is really about getting in tune with your body and understanding what the edge between a sustainable and an unsustainable effort feels like. Not being able to complete this workout is fairly common, so don't beat yourself up if you can't make it through the first few times. As long as you come away from this session with a better understanding of how to pace longer efforts, you've improved as an athlete.\n",

Both phenomenal athletes with unique stories who are both at a crossroads in their careers, we are given a rare and unguarded insight into Cam and Taylor's lives and careers, revealing what makes them tick as people and athletes.

Celebrated as a talented racer during his historic triple win in the Ardennes classics, the Italian fell after his positive test at the Beijing Olympics. His bronze medal would have a bitter aftertaste, that of the era of cycling in the \u201990s to which he belongs. Rebellin contests but returns his medal and serves a two-year suspension. In a sport that discards its black sheep and welcomes back others, Rebellin finds refuge in a modest Polish team upon his return and skims the minor races while former colleagues Basso, Scarponi, and Di Luca came back to the top level of the sport unscathed.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe years go by and on the road to redemption, the Venetian ends up stranded on the other side of the Mediterranean. An Algerian team takes him in without a contract. With neither air-conditioned bus nor energy bars, Rebellin stocks up on dates from the hills of Oran and turns his legs, sometimes 6 to 7 hours in a single day. In the peloton, while rubbing against riders half his age, Rebellin never forgets to remove his glasses at key moments of the race to gain clarity, as in 2004, in the wall of Huy. A resolute morning gaze of this touching fragility which earned him, in his early days, a nickname: \u201cIl Chierichetto\u201d (\u201cthe choirboy\u201d). Wrinkles have now carved out furrows on his face and his style is now less explosive. Davide has aged. He is 47 years old at the time of filming. On the starting line, some admire him, others sigh.\n\n\u200b\n\nCan Davide still win? The ambition? Passion? The fear? Or the search for forgiveness?\n\n\u200b\n\n\ud83d\udeb4 Workout: The workout accompanying this film is a recovery session. Intensity is low, with power remaining at or below 50% of FTP (2.5 on a scale from 1 to 10) with heart rate targets entirely in Zone 2. The intensity and cadence targets will vary throughout this session to keep it interesting, but not so much that it distracts you from the story.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

Overall intensity is low, but a couple of short cadence and intensity pyramids provide the stimulus necessary to activate your nervous system and keep the mind engaged. When you finish, you should feel more energized and ready to tackle the next workout with renewed motivation and power.\n",

                    "body": "This is a technique-focused session designed to develop your agility, stability, range of motion, and foot speed. There is no focus on heart rate zones so you may choose to leave your monitor at home for these sessions. Between sets of each drill, you should jog/walk easily to fully recover between the efforts. While these efforts shouldn\u2019t be too taxing on you, the key is perfect form, so you want to be hitting each one rested enough that you can maintain great form for the duration. You should take a bit of extra rest between techniques, again to ensure you are rested and can nail the form. Before starting the workout, familiarize yourself with the format for high knees, butt kicks, skipping, carioca and strides. Find a flat track, field, or 50-100m of open space to perform this workout (football and soccer fields are great for this).\n\n\u200b\n\nFor help understanding your run workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-up:**\n\nStart off with 5-10 minutes of easy jogging/walking.\n\nHigh Knees: 2-3 sets of 50m high knees.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Take short strides, bringing your knees up high enough that your upper legs are parallel to the ground. Focus on achieving high knees AND quick turnover, or performing as many reps as possible in a short distance.\n\n**Butt Kicks:**\n\n2-3 sets of 50m butt kicks.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- This should actually look similar to a high knee drill, but with the heels coming up to touch the bottom of your butt. Take short strides while using your hamstrings to lift your heels up beneath your butt. Your knees should come up in front of your body while pulling your heels up beneath your hips, rather than keeping your quads and knees below and in line with your hips.\n\n**Skipping:**\n\n3-4 sets of 50m skipping.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between.\n\n- Focus on a high knee drive and swinging your arms at your sides like you would when running.\n\n**Carioca:**\n\n4 sets of 30m Carioca in each direction (8 total).\n\nRest for 20 seconds between direction changes (at your discretion).\n\n- For this drill, you need to face sidewise to the direction you want to go. Start off moving to the right. Bring your left knee up and across your body and put your left foot in front of your right foot. Step your right foot to the right so it is parallel with your left leg again (at this point you should be positioned in the same direction and orientation that you were at the start. Next step your left leg behind your right leg, again so it lands on the right side of your right leg. Then bring your right leg back across your body, once again ending up in the starting position. Repeat this pattern for 25-30m.\n\n**Strides:**\n\n2-3 sets of 60m; Gradually build effort from RPE 3-8.\n\nEasy jog/walk for 30-60 seconds between. These are comprised of a steady acceleration over 60-80m up to 5k pace. The goal is to increase speed after each step, so you are reaching maximum speed at the end of the 60-80m stretch. You want to focus on keeping your shoulders, neck, and jaw relaxed while maintaining strong knee drive, straight and compact arm swing, planting the feet beneath the hips, and fast turnover.\n\n\u200b\n\nHigh Knees + Butt Kicks: \n\nFinish these drills with one set each of 50m high knees and butt kicks.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool-down:**\n\nWalk or jog for 5 minutes to cool down.\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your running [drills](https://wahoosystm.com/RunningSessionFAQ)\n",

Today's session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- \\*Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- \\*Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- \\*Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- \\*Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- \\*Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- \\*Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- \\*Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10 seconds rest\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance:\n\n200m Pull @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs. It requires a buoy that you can swim with between your legs. The buoy will keep your body in the correct orientation. By removing your legs from the drill you will be required to only use your arms. This will help you focus on efficient form and making the most of each stroke!\n\nRecovery: 20 seconds rest\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nThe following should all be done at a moderate pace (RPE 2-4 -- Z1-Z2), with enough rest between that you can focus on proper form\n\nInterval 1: 150m of One Arm Freestyle drill\n\n- This is an old standby. Put your non-pulling arm out in front of your body and swim with only the opposite arm. Take some time to watch the arm that is pulling. Feel your elbow directly above your hand and that you are pulling right down the midline of your body. Split your body in half with your fingertips. Your emphasis should be on power and efficiency not on speed.\n- See how few strokes you can take to get down the pool.\n- Once you have it mastered, you can leave the non-pulling arm at your side.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 2: 200m of 3/4 Catch Up drill\n\n- A variation to catch-up that takes us closer to the full stroke. Another way to describe this is almost catch-up. Take a stroke with the right hand, wait until this hand is almost all the way through recovery and then start your pull with the left. This creates a very rhythmic feel, almost like skating through the water. Take your pull and ride the glide from it. When you lose speed, take your next pull. Want a good example of this? Watch Olympic replays of the Aussies, particularly Ian Thorpe. He races like this drill. Efficiency is your goal.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 3: 200m of Elbow-Hip-Elbow drill\n\n- A variation on side glide kick. The same goals apply balance, body roll, and head position during breathing. Start on either side with one arm extended out front, and the other at your side. With the fingers of the hand at your side, touch the elbow of your upper arm, then your hip, and then the elbow again. Now take your stroke or three strokes. Kick and glide and repeat.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 4: 150m of Fist Drill\n\n- Swim freestyle with your hands in fists. This is going to force you to get your forearms involved in the stroke because they have more surface area than your hands. Keep your elbow high under the water. Your forearm, from elbow to fingertips should be perpendicular to the bottom of the pool. Again, watch Ian Thorpe. You will feel like you are slipping through the water which is normal, however, the more water you feel like you are pulling the more efficient you are getting.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 5: 200m of Zipper Drill\n\n- This drill is done by pulling the fingers up the side of the body until they come into the armpit. The point of this is to keep a nice high elbow on recovery and to force the body to roll.

Today's session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of your choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- \\*Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- \\*Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- \\*Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- \\*Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- \\*Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- \\*Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- \\*Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10-sec rest\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance: 100m kick @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This drill requires you to only use your legs for propulsion. Face the sky with your arms extended above your head, biceps squeezing your ears. Kick from the hips with straight legs, toes just breaking the surface of the water. When you see the flags above your head, flip onto your belly so you don't hit the wall. Make note if there are no flags at your pool before doing this drill so you can look for another sign that the wall is near.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation 3**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance: 100m Pull @ RPE 3-4 -- Z2\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs to focus on your catch and pull. Squeeze a pull buoy between your legs to keep your hips afloat and body in the correct orientation.\n- While the back of the hand always faces the direction of travel and the elbow remains the highest point of the stroke, your leading hand spears the water and the Catch phase is initiated by obtaining a grasp on the water while reaching forward. This first phase is not about producing power, rather, it sets you up for the Pull and Push Phases. Imagine pulling yourself over a barrel. Hold as much water as possible while pulling, then pushing the water back to your thigh keeping the hand on the inside on the elbow. Your stroke should accelerate as you progress through the Pull and Push Phases. There is a subtle S formation that occurs during the phases, starting with the Pull Phase just above the shoulder and continuing through the Push Phase until your hand exits the water to begin the recovery phase. Always imagine a line dividing your body lengthwise, with your left arm staying on the left side and your right arm staying on the right side. Crossover will result in additional drag and unwanted sway in the lower body.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Set**\n\nComplete at least six of the drills that you struggle the most with. Aim for 150-200m of each one. The only way to get better is to work on your weaknesses! So be honest with yourself and pick the drills you have the hardest time with.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE < 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200b\n\n**Total Distance**\n\n2000m\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs. \n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.  Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200b\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\" Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200b\n\nSounds simple right?  It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.  You will have to trust us on that one!  When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions!  Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70% \n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets\n\n8.5\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set\n\n1\n\nInterval:\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

In the mid-'90s Professor Izumi Tabata set out to study the training impact of HIIT compared to a more traditional lower intensity high volume training. While both groups saw a similar increase in VO2max, only the HIIT group improved their Anaerobic Capacity, which is often associated with an increased ability to repeat hard efforts.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe HIIT protocol that Professor Izumi Tabata used was 4-minute blocks broken into what we refer to as \"Micro-Intervals\" 20sec efforts well above VO2max power (similar to what we refer to as MAP) and 10 seconds of recovery.\nThis was one of the first widely recognized studies that promoted HIIT, and since HIIT is The Sufferfest's Specialty, we would be crazy not to include this session.\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring this session, you are looking at 3 sets of Micro-Intervals in 4-minute blocks, with each 20sec power target exceeding 100% of your MAP. While the targets we have set are slightly lower than Tabata's original study, those subjects only completed one 4-minute block of their high-intensity session, and you get to complete 3 of them! That means if you finish the first set feeling fine, increase MAP intensity by 5%, or just switch to slope mode and get back to using RPE; these are MAX intervals after all, so just give it what you've got!\n\n\nThis session really does pack a punch, and being mentally prepared for it is more important than being physically prepared. By design, this session will completely drain your AC and max out your aerobic system. No one gets to that point and feels \"good.\" You need to mentally brace yourself to get into the hurt locker and stay down there until the bitter end.\n\n\u200b\n\nUncertain if you have that mental toughness or skill set to handle this session? Then check out the \"Getting Positive\" module on our Mental Toughness Program. While we encourage everyone to try MTP from start to finish (which takes about 10 weeks) just doing this one module can be incredibly beneficial.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n2.5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Efforts**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 6 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 8\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 20 seconds @ RPE 10 -- MAX EFFORT\n\nRecovery: 10 seconds @ RPE 1 -- <45% of FTP\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n6 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The only time we would suggest Erg mode is if you are unable to maintain the lower power targets set between sprints.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith short maximal sprint efforts, you'll recruit every muscle fiber you have in your legs each effort. While cadence builds force your muscles to contract and relax as quickly as possible, this session forces your muscles to contract with maximal force. Just like cadence builds this session becomes one of the best ways to train your neuromuscular system. Even if your target event does not require you to complete maximal sprints, there is a substantial trickle-down effect to the longer duration power efforts when you train your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session is a great alternate to cadence builds or standing starts for those completing our SUF Strength sessions. On days you completely off the bike strength work you want your on-bike training to complement the suffering you put yourself through off the bike. That means short maximal efforts (whether for power or for cadence) are the best workouts to complement the strength gains you've made off the bike.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs long as you run this session in slope mode you can complete the sprints either seated or out of the saddle. For those competing in events that do not require much (if any) standing (such as Time Trials or Triathlons) you should complete these sprints seated (and in the aero bars or drops if that is where you are racing).\n\nYou should also do these efforts seated if you don't feel an out-of-the-saddle maximal sprint is stable/safe to do on your trainer. Regardless of using ERG or Slope mode, you do not want to hold anything back on any sprint. Seeing your peak power drop as the session goes on is totally normal as your legs fatigue. This is where RPE really becomes the most important metric, rather than power, heart rate, or cadence. Now get on that bike and CRUSH IT!\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 12\n\n**Interval **\n\nSprint: 10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- MAX SPRINT\n\nRecovery: 5 minutes 50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The starting effort should just about completely drain your Anaerobic Capacity (AC), which will leave you gasping for air as you start each 40-second MAP effort. By forcing yourself to maintain MAP after a maximal sprint, you are asking your body to increase oxygen supply to your muscles as quickly as possible by increasing your heart rate and breathing rate. Being able to increase oxygen consumption rapidly means your body will better handle changes in pace both above and below threshold.\n\n**What you need to do:**\n\n- You'll need to begin each Standing Start at super low RPMs with very high torque (high resistance). To maximize muscle recruitment you want to both push-down and pull-up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must, as your legs need a sturdy backboard to push against.\n- You'll want the starting resistance to be just high enough that only your max effort can get the pedals moving; after those first few revs, your goal is to get your cadence up as high as possible by the end of the 20 seconds.\n- For smart trainer users, the best way to ensure you have the right resistance is to complete this session in Level Mode rather than ERG Mode.\n- Once the 20-second start is over you want to settle right into the 40-second effort at MAP, avoiding any significant drop in power at the transition point. Since the goal of this 40-second MAP effort is maximal cardiovascular demand, aim to hold your cadence 10-15 RPM higher than you would for the 5-minute test in Full Frontal.\n\n**For Time Trialists and Triathletes:**\n\nAfter the Standing Start, you will want to get into your aero bars and hold the same position you will be competing in. Those on regular road bikes should get down into the drops.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n2 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR < 80%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 5\n\n**Interval **\n\nStanding Start: 20 seconds @ RPE 10 --\n\nStarting from standing (or very very very slow rolling) starts in a 53x14 gear.

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.\n\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval **\n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n9 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Even though these efforts are under FTP, the high leg speed required will leave your system working harder than usual for the required power output.\n\n\nBy maintaining the highest cadence possible (without bouncing in the saddle) you end up pushing your neuromuscular coordination near its limits in a similar way to Cadence Builds.\n\n\u200b\n\nWith an emphasis on low torque (high RPM) efforts, this session is the polar opposite to sessions like GOAT and Power Station. Even though these efforts are short and below FTP the high cadence places more of a load on your cardiovascular system, so expect your heart rate and breathing to be higher than normal for the power.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince muscles can only contract (pull) any given muscle will primarily move a joint in a single direction. When it comes to pedaling a bike, your quads and glutes can push the pedals down, while your hamstrings and hip flexors pull the pedals back up (with the help of your glutes and quads on the other leg). If you were to pedal with one leg (as you do in Cadence Drills) and your hamstrings and glutes were unable to contract, once you get to the bottom of the pedal stroke your leg would be stuck down there. No matter how hard you might try, your glutes and quads will do nothing to help you get that pedal all the way around. Suppose you do have both feet clipped in, and you are letting your opposite leg push down to bring your leg back up to 12 o'clock. If your quads and glutes are still contracting (pushing the pedal down) while the glutes and quads of your other leg are starting to push their pedal down, you will end up with one leg working against the other. You must relax the glutes and quads of one leg to get all of the power out of the glutes and quads of your other leg.\n\nThis is where neuromuscular coordination comes into play. During each pedal revolution, your legs have to \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d almost all of the muscles in your legs. By maintaining your highest cadence without bouncing, you are pushing all of the muscles in each leg to contract and relax (switch on and off) as quickly as possible.\n\n\nWhile we give specific cadence targets in this session, everyone has a different limit to what cadence they can maintain before bouncing in the saddle. To get the intended benefit of this session you need to maintain the power targets at the highest cadence that YOU can maintain. For some that might be 105RPM, for others, it might be 150RPM. What matters is that you push YOUR neuromuscular system to its limits.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 5\n\n**Interval **\n\nEffort: 5 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- 100+ RPM -- HR <95%\n\nRecovery: 8 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n18 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The difference is that the overall stress on your system when riding tempo is considerably less than riding at FTP. That means you can either have harder days before or after a tempo session (compared to a Threshold session) or you can increase the duration of those tempo efforts to make the overall training stimulus equal (or greater) than completing several repeats right at your FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis tempo effort is divided into 3 segments of equal duration. While the power is the same across all segments, your target cadence starts and low and increases with each new segment. Starting with a long block of low cadence should fatigue your muscles from the start of your effort. As the effort builds and you create more fatigue, the increased cadence targets will place a greater demand on your cardiovascular system. That will, in some way, feel like a nice break given the load you have been putting on your muscular system. The cadence targets in the final segment will force your fatigued muscles to maintain good coordination as the faster cadence requires your muscles to switch \"on\" and \"off\" at a faster rate. Between the low rpm sections, and the high rpm work under fatigue, this tempo session not only helps train your FTP, but it has a training benefit to your neuromuscular system.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou can expect your Heart Rate to remain low for the power targets during the low cadence segment at the start. As the effort progresses and you reach the final 10 minutes of the high rpm segment your heart rate might go over Z3, which is not something to worry about. While this session appears \"easy\" at first glance, don't be surprised if your legs are feeling it the next day.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 15 minutes @ RPE 5.5 -- 80% of FTP-- 55-65 RPM -- HR <85%\n\nEffort 2: 15 minutes @ RPE 5.5 -- 80% of FTP-- 70-80 RPM -- HR <90%\n\nEffort 3: 15 minutes @ RPE 5.5 -- 80% of FTP-- 90+ RPM -- HR <95%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR < 70%\n",

We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \"Negative-Split\", meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \"easier\" tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session contains a single 30-minute tempo effort, broken into three 10-minute segments. You will spend the first 10-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 10 at 84%, and the final 10 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\n\u200b\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled and mental fatigue will all play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling. This can be a great session to act as a \"wake up call\" on any poor training habits you might have, so take note and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort 1: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP-- HR <85%\n\nEffort 2: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 83% of FTP-- HR <90%\n\nEffort 3: 10 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 87% of FTP-- HR <95%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR < 70%\n",

                    "body": "Just like Fight Club and Who Dares, this session is all about surging well above threshold, and then trying to recover without dropping your power anywhere close to your recovery zone. The 2 things that make this session stand out are:\n\n1. You only have one single continuous effort (which happens to be 45-minutes in length)\n2. Your recovery power is low Tempo, which is good because any higher than that and you wouldn't last the full 60 minutes!\n\nAs you increase the intensity from 80% of FTP up to 100% of FTP, your legs begin to produce more and more metabolites, but the rate at which your body CAN clear them is almost the same. As you close in on 100% of FTP you suddenly are at a point where the production of metabolites equals your clearance rate. Now move just a bit over FTP and those metabolites are going to continue to build until you drop your effort back below FTP.\n\n\nTo improve your body's clearance rate for those metabolites, you need to spend a decent amount of time with more of those metabolites in your system than your body's current clearance rate can handle.\n\n\nThat is what this session is all about, short hard efforts above FTP to build an excess of metabolites, followed by steady riding at 80% of FTP. This steady-state effort between surges is high enough that your body will still be working at max clearance rates but low enough that you can keep doing those surges over and over again, which is good for you because this is not a short interval.\n\n\nWhile you can achieve the same training stimuli by holding shorter blocks above FTP, those sessions have their drawbacks. The main one is nailing the exact right intensity above FTP that will allow you to accumulate enough time in that metabolite flooded state. While we like to think our FTP is set in stone, the reality is it can fluctuate from day to day, which makes finding that balancing point for a session like that so difficult. You can easily go too hard and blow up early, or not go hard enough and never really push that clearance rate to the max. By hitting surges well above FTP, then holding an effort a good deal below FTP, any day to day variation in your FTP becomes less of an issue because you never have to dance 5W above or below it.\n\n\nThe added benefit to this Surge and Settle workout style is the boost it can give to your Anaerobic Capacity. An improved AC means you can recover faster, not just from sprint type efforts, but from repeated MAP and FTP efforts as well.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 9\n\n**Interval **\n\nSurge: 20 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP\n\nSteady: 4min 40sec @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n1 hour 15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.  \nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.  \nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.  \nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.  \nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%  \n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85%  \n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR < 90%  \n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95%  \n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 115% of FTP  \n6 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <80%  \n  \n**Main Effort **Number of Sets: 3  \nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval **Surge: 20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 90% of AC (135-190%+ of FTP)  \nSteady: 15 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%  \n  \n**Extra Volume **NA  \n  \n**Cool Down **4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%  \n",

                    "body": "Good swimming technique is the key to efficient swimming. Today's session is a low intensity workout that challenges you with a series of drills designed to reinforce proper technique that will make you a more efficient, powerful and faster swimmer.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn case you need to brush up on your other swimming [technique definitions or drills](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterSwimDrills).\n\nFor help understanding your swim workout and calculating your pace zones, please see [this article](https://wahoosystm.com/SwimSessionFAQ).\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation 1**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4\n\nInterval Distance: 25m Drill of your choice\n\nThe goal of a Drill set is not to swim at any given pace, but instead focus on proper form. Choose a drill or focus on one of these key points for each 25m interval:\n\n- Body position- swim on horizontal plane\n- Enter in front of shoulder- preventing cross over\n- Breathe early- prevent wide stroke- elbow is always widest point\n- Elbow is always the highest point of the stroke\n- Back of hand always faces direction of travel\n- Fingers to point at the bottom of pool\n- Initiate your stroke from the hips\n\nRecovery: 10 sec rest\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nInterval Distance: 200m Kick @ RPE 5 -- Z3\n\n- This drill requires you to only use your legs for propulsion. Face the sky with your arms extended above your head, biceps squeezing your ears. Kick from the hips with straight legs, toes just breaking the surface of the water. When you see the flags above your head, flip onto your belly so you don't hit the wall. Make note if there are no flags at your pool before doing this drill so you can look for another sign that the wall is near.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nThe following should all be done at a moderate pace (RPE 2-4 -- Z1-Z2), with enough rest between that you can focus on proper form\n\nInterval 1: 100m of Super Slow Drill\n\n- This should be done for 25m at a time. Slow down your stroke rate as much as possible. In fact, the point here is to see how slowly you can go without sinking. Work hard to swim with perfect form concentrating not on how much water you are pulling but rather what position your hands, body, and feet are in. This drill will help you keep your balance in the water. If you can balance going slow, you can balance going fast.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 2: 100m swim, incorporating the\n\nInterval 3: 150m of 3-3-3 Drill\n\n- Simply put, take three strokes with your left, three with your right, and three whole strokes (6 arm pulls). This is good for a couple of things: First, continue to work on the efficiency of the one-arm strokes. Secondly, When you switch sides, you want to work on the transfer of power from right to left. Then when you take full strokes, you can quickly get into long, efficient strokes.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 3: 200m of Catch Up Drill\n\n- Another old standby. Swim freestyle one arm at a time. Take a stroke with the right and touch your left arm that is out in front of the body. Then take your pull with the left hand. Be sure that you are not rushing. Get as much out of each arm stroke that you can. Remember, freestyle is not of stroke of constant propulsion. It is a pull with the left and then the right. It is important that we approach it this way.\n\nRecovery: 20 sec rest\n\nInterval 4: 200m of Side-Glide-Kick Drill\n\n- Push off the wall on your side and kick for eight kicks. Keep your ear on your arm and your body straight. Make sure your knees are passing one another when you kick. After eight kicks, take a good pull with the arm on top. Use this pull to roll you to the other side and repeat the cycle. For variation do this drill with three strokes in between. I.e. on the right side with the right arm up and the left arm at your side. Take a pull with the right, left, and then right. End with your left arm up and your right arm at your side. This will help your body position in the water and if you keep your head on your arm when you are on your side it will help your head position when you breathe.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 5: 200m of Corkscrew Swim\n\n- This is done by alternating one stroke of freestyle and one stroke of backstroke. This repetition makes you roll over and around from front to back repeatedly, thus \"corkscrewing.\u201d This is useful because most of us will want to cross our bodies when we roll from our back to our stomach. Fight this and try to take perfect midline strokes over and over.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nInterval 6: 200m Pull\n\n- This set eliminates the use of your legs to focus on your catch and pull. Squeeze a pull buoy between your legs to keep your hips afloat and body in the correct orientation.\n- While the back of the hand always faces the direction of travel and the elbow remains the highest point of the stroke, your leading hand spears the water and the Catch phase is initiated by obtaining a grasp on the water while reaching forward. This first phase is not about producing power, rather, it sets you up for the Pull and Push Phases. Imagine pulling yourself over a barrel. Hold as much water as possible while pulling, then pushing the water back to your thigh keeping the hand on the inside on the elbow. Your stroke should accelerate as you progress through the Pull and Push Phases. There is a subtle S formation that occurs during the phases, starting with the Pull Phase just above the shoulder and continuing through the Push Phase until your hand exits the water to begin the recovery phase. Always imagine a line dividing your body lengthwise, with your left arm staying on the left side and your right arm staying on the right side. Crossover will result in additional drag and unwanted sway in the lower body.\n\nRecovery: 20-sec rest\n\nRepeat until full swim time is completed as directed by your training plan\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n200m stroke of your choice @ RPE < 2 -- Z1\n\n\u200b\n\n**Total Distance**\n\n1750m\n",

For this workout, you will complete a series of 4-minute efforts. The first 3-minutes are right at your FTP, which isn't so tough in itself, but the final 1-minute of each effort are set above 90% of MAP.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhen we talk about a \"negative split\" we mean completing the second half of an effort at a higher speed/power than the first half. By the time you hit the MAP portion of each interval, your heart rate and breathing rate will already be nice and high. This limits the AC demand of a standalone MAP effort, where you have a large lag time between producing the power requirement, and your body delivering the oxygen needed to hold that power. Usually, that lag time between oxygen demand and oxygen supply is covered by your AC. Paced correctly, your heart rate should essentially be increasing for the entire 4-minutes, as it will be settling into LTHR right as you up the power output.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs you complete each effort, holding 100% of FTP will feel harder and harder. This in itself is excellent mental practice for \"feeling\" how your RPE for the same power can drift up as fatigue sets in. Knowing what 100% of FTP feels like when your legs are nearly spent is a great reminder of why starting an effort too hard will bite you in the end.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis workout ends up delivering a fantastic aerobic workload as you complete 8-minutes of MAP work with minimal help from your AC, making this an excellent session for those who have a strong AC but weak MAP. You also rack up 24-minutes at 100% of FTP, which by itself would be a good training load. Add in these MAP efforts, and you multiply the training impact of those 24-minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nRegardless of your chosen discipline or event, this is a session that will benefit everyone, both regarding learning good pacing and giving your aerobic system a big training boost.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-135% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nFTP Effort: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\nVO2 Effort: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of MAP (105-130% of FTP) \n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70% \n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 1 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Starting from 20 minutes of low Tempo, and finishing with 4-minutes of high-quality MAP work, proper pacing is crucial to success in this workout. While you could easily be above target power for the entire 20-minute effort, that would set you up to fail in the last two efforts. Be smart and pace yourself; you can always go harder in the final 5-minute effort if you want to!\n\n\nAt any intensity above Endurance pace, the longer you ride, the more fatigued you become. Completing the final 5-minute target when fresh would be unpleasant, hitting it after all of these other intervals makes it a near maximal effort. Proper hydration/cooling and nutrition are vital if you want to nail this workout.\n\n\nIf you are preparing for any longer ride/event where you will be required to keep on the gas from start to finish, this is the perfect session for you. Completing these efforts in this order not only gives a great physical training boost but also toughens you up mentally. Digging deep when fatigued is the key to good performance over longer distances, so expect to suffer in that final 5-minute effort; it will pay off both mentally and physically!\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 4, all unique\n\nRest Between Sets: 12 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: N/A\n\n**Set 1** (20-minute Effort)\n\nSteady: 20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 85% of FTP-- HR <95%\n\n**Set 2** x4(16-minute Effort) \n\nSteady: 3 minutes @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 7.75 -- 105% of FTP-- HR <105%\n\n**Set 3 **(8-minute Effort)\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 6 minutes @ RPE 7.25 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\nSurge: 1 minute @ RPE 9 -- 95% of MAP (110-135% of FTP)\n\n**Set 4 **(4-minute Effort)\n\nEffort 1: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nEffort 2: 1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP\n\nEffort 3: 1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 90% of MAP (105-125% of FTP)\n\nEffort 4: 1 minute @ RPE 9.5 -- 100+% of MAP (120-150% of FTP)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70\n",

We know you can go harder for 25-minutes, but that is not the point of a Tempo Session.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat many people don't realize is that your body's ability to process oxygen and metabolites is nearly identical from 80%-100% of FTP. The main change across that intensity range is the rate at which those metabolites are being generated. While you would get a slightly greater training load from doing this session at higher power, you would be adding more fatigue to your system than we want. That extra fatigue means you either need to ease off your workouts in the days leading up or ease off your workouts on the days after. From a big picture point of view that's no good! This session gives a great steady-state aerobic training load while leaving you fresh enough that you can hit training hard the days before and after. That means your training load over the entire week is often higher when you maintain restraint and stick to those Tempo Targets.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR <105%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 3\n\n**Interval **\n\nEffort: 20 minutes @ RPE 5.5 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\nRecovery: 15 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n2 hours @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The skills practiced here are done below race pace so you can focus on proper execution. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \nA set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \nA flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \nA hill to practice off-camber riding.  \nBarriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include 2 x 1 minute Z3 efforts to warm up.  \n  \nStairs. Complete 3-4 sets:  \nApproach the stairs at a decent speed (but don\u2019t go over a Z3 effort).  \nDismount and focus on the technique needed to maintain your momentum up the stairs. Experiment with both the timing of your dismount and how you hold your bike while running up the stairs. You may wish to sling it over your shoulder or pick it up by the top tube and handlebars.  \nAt the top remount as smoothly as possible while trying to maintain your forward momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201cTips for Figure 8s\u201d.  \nSet up two bottles or cones roughly 20m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nFocus on maintaining your speed, and try to avoid accelerating or surging out of the \u201cturns\u201d.  \nIf you\u2019re feeling frisky you can break up the Figure 8s with 50-75m Field Runs every couple minutes.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-8 sets:  \nNext, set up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nHit your barrer section at a decent speed (again trying to avoid going over Z3).  \nPractice and perfect the timing of your dismount and remount. The key here is keeping your leg speed quick and nimble between the barriers!  \n  \nOff-Camber Riding. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nRide to the top of the hill and then ride along the length of the crest. Try to hold a straight line while not gaining or losing elevation.  \nTurn around and ride it in the opposite direction.  \nAs your off-camber skills develop you can try riding faster and faster to see where your limit is, and sometimes that means going over it!

If you find a section that you struggle to hit cleanly, repeat that section a few times until you feel comfortable with it. Don\u2019t feel the need to practice every section you struggle with on a single ride, you can always come back another day! Keep the effort below 85% of FTP and spend the bulk of the ride around 60% of FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nMake sure to warm up well and cool down afterwards.\n",

The skills practiced here are done at race pace so you can focus on proper execution while under pressure. To properly complete this ride you will need to find a field with the following features and bring along some equipment:  \n  \n- A set of stairs, ideally with enough area at the top to practice re-mounting your bike.  \n- A flat, open area to practice Figure 8s. Use water bottles or cones to mark the corners.  \n- A hill to practice off-camber riding.  \n- Barriers about shin high, which can be made from PVC pipe or improvised using your imagination (and a few water bottles).  \n- BONUS: an area with sand or deep and loose dirt.  \n  \nHere\u2019s how to tackle this session:  \n  \nWarm-up for 10-15 minutes Z1/Z2 spinning, include two 3-5 second hard accelerations.  \n  \nHole Shot + Stairs. Complete 2 sets:  \nSimulate your race start by lining up 300-400m away from the stairs, in your starting gear and with one foot unclipped.  \nCountdown from 10 and you\u2019re OFF! Clip in and complete an all out 15 second effort.  \nWork on shifting up smoothly during the effort as you would in a race.  \nContinue the effort around Z3/Z4 effort for 60 seconds while riding towards the base of the stairs.  \nDismount and run up the stairs and remount at the top.  \nBetween the first and second set, do 50-100m of Field Running.  \n  \nBarriers. Complete 4-6 sets:  \nSet up some barriers (you can make a portable set from PVC pipe, or you can use some water bottles and your imagination).  \nStarting about 100m out from your barriers, speed towards the barriers at race pace.  \nThe challenge is to focus on the timing of your dismount and remount and to keep you leg speed high between the barriers in order to maintain the most momentum.  \n  \nFigure 8s. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nFor more info on Figure 8s read \u201cTips for Figure 8s\u201d.  \nSet up 2 bottles about 30m apart and practice your Figure 8s.  \nTo simulate a race scenario, drive your first 3-4 pedal strokes super hard coming out of each \u201cturn\u201d.  \nAlternate seated efforts and standing efforts and experiment with your gearing to find the best fit for your desired cadence and power.  \n  \nSand Pit. Complete 5-10 minutes:  \nIf you also have access to a sand pit then finish with 4-6 efforts through the sand. See \u201cTips For Sand\u201d to master this skill.  \nFinish with 5-10 minutes of easy spinning to cool down.  \n  \n**Warm-Up **8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%  \n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <75%  \n1 minutes @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <75%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR < 100%  \n50 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR < 70%  \n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 150% of FTP -- HR < 100%  \n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%  \n  \n**Main Effort **  \nNumber of Sets: 4  \nRest Between Sets: 2 minutes  \nInterval Repeats per Set: 1  \n**Interval**  \n8 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70% focusing on assigned skill  \n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%  \n  \n**Extra volume **  \nN/A  \n  \n**Cool Down **  \n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%  \n",

Extend the left arm out in front of shoulder, grab hold of the imaginary rope between your thumb and forefinger, then pretend you are swimming over a barrel extending the arm down your side, before returning your arm to the front by creeping it underwater up the side of your body. Arms should be in opposite positions. Head above the water as this gives you the opportunity to see where your arms are! If you have the availability, use the blue or black line as a reference guide. Recovery: 15 sec rest\n\n**Activation 2**\n\nNumber of Sets: 6\n\nInterval: 50m as: 25m zipper drill, 25m free @ RPE 3 -- Z2\n\n- This drill is done by pulling the fingers up the side of the body until they come up into the armpit. The point of this is to keep a nice high elbow on recovery and to force the body to roll. Many use the Fingertip drag drill to accomplish this. We prefer this drill as it incorporates the body roll for more bang for your buck.

It trains your ability to generate force through the pedals by ensuring you recruit ALL of your muscles to get that crank turning. No matter your preferred discipline, these efforts are key to teaching your body to recruit all of the muscle fibers in your legs. The saying \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d actually does apply here.\n\n\u200b\n\nAll of the benefits in this session come from hitting these 20-second efforts as hard as you possibly can. To do that, you need full recovery between each sprint, and you need to respect that recovery! These efforts should see you start at super low RPMs with very high torque. As you start and increase the effort, your cadence will naturally increase. Your goal is to get your cadence as high as possible by the end of each 20-second effort. To maximize your muscle recruitment, you want to both push down and pull up on the pedals at the start. Proper core engagement is a must - your legs need a good strong backboard to push against.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe understand that not everyone's trainer has the necessary resistance or the required stability to perform this workout as described. If you can't safely stand up, then you can get much of the same benefit by doing these efforts seated. If your trainer can\u2019t handle the rapid change in speed or does not have high enough resistance at a super low cadence, then you can start the efforts at a higher cadence and treat them as \u201cnormal\u201d all-out sprints.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR < 80%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval **\n\nStanding Start: 20 seconds @ RPE 10 --\n\nStarting from standing (or very very very slow rolling) starts in a 53x14 gear.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4.\n\n\u200b\n\nSounds simple right? It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 7\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 1\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Begin by running into water and as you progress deeper into the water, be sure you are picking up your legs and raising your knees before duck diving is required. Once the water has reached hip height begin swimming. Once in the water, pick an object and sight every 30 strokes. Complete your effort and on the return, swim back to the beach entry utilize the currents and surge from the waves back in to the beach. Practice Swimming in a straight line and focus on maintaining your technique throughout.\n\n\u200b\n\nLake Shore Entry- Follow the steps above\n\nDock Entry- If safe to do so, check surroundings to be sure they are safe for diving. From a standing start with a slight bend to the knees and your toes gripping the dock, bend forward from the hips keeping your buttocks raised, place one hand on top of the other, then place your head between your arms so that your chin is on your chest. As you push with your legs propel your body forward with your finger tips entering the water first. Once in the water, pick an object and sight every 30 strokes. Practice Swimming in a straight line and focus on maintaining your technique throughout.\n\nPool- Begin by treading water and swim sighting every 30 strokes. Turnaround to be executed without touching the wall. If you have the ability, begin by diving in.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n4 minutes freestyle swim @ RPE 1-2 -- Z1 Pace\n\n\u200b\n\n**Activation**\n\n6 minutes- Pick a landmark or object and swim towards it @ RPE 5-6 -- Z3 Pace sighting every 30 strokes.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Set**\n\nPerform 6 Ins and outs.

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200b\n\nSounds simple right? It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

There's just one hour of racing left and you're sitting at the top of the virtual GC on the last day of the Tour of Norway, your home tour \u2014 Of any day to go all out and empty the tank, today is the day \u2014 Take your pulls, lead the breakaway and fight to stay away from the peloton.\n\n\u200b\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00ae profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00ae profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It's the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

The descending time intervals allow for increasing intensity, beginning below threshold and finishing above it, at 105% of your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP). At the sub-threshold intensities, your body can clear lactate at the same rate or faster than you produce it. As intensity increases however, the clearing rate decreases, resulting in that well-known leg burn. Increasing the intensity in this manner with short recovery periods teaches your body to clear lactate faster so you can ride harder for longer. So get ready to churn through some lactic acid and embrace the burn as the intervals get shorter and harder!\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minute @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Part 1 **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Part 2 **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Part 3** x8\n\n10 seconds @ RPE 10 -- 200% of FTP -- >105%\n\n1 minute 20 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 3\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 3\n\n**Interval**\n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP)\n\nSteady: 2 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n8 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

This is a great workout to help build your fitness for sustained and repeating climbing efforts up steep mountains.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP-- HR <70%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 4 -- 70% of FTP -- HR <90\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 8.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 150% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n15 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n1 minute 30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 4 sets, all unique\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\n**Set 1:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Set 2:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Set 3:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n**Set 4:**\n\nEffort 1: 8 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\nRecovery 1: 1 minute @ RPE 1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 2: 2 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nRecovery 3: 1 minutes @ RPE2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE1 -- 40% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n45 seconds @ RPE 1 -- 35% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high and your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right! Most people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nTruth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride, especially one under 90 minutes should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted.\n\nSo what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like? For 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in low to mid Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can; for most this is 80-90rpm. Also, your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200b\n\nSounds simple right? It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster, but you will have to trust us on this one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions, or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats Per Set: 2\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs. \n\nThis session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.  Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week, but only if you do it right!\n\n\u200b\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\" Truth be told, a proper Zone 2 ride should not leave you fatigued or your legs wasted. So what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70% is ok, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.) Your heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm and your RPE should be a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10.\n\n\u200b\n\nSounds simple right?  It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster.

Upon finishing the run, take a few moments to eat and drink if necessary then hop back on the bike for the second set.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis workout is a great opportunity to practice a negative split pacing technique. Begin the first cycling session at 55% of FTP to get warmed up and gradually increase to 90%. Aim to hold 75-90% of FTP for the last 60-75 minutes.  On the second cycling set, begin at 70% and increase to 90% after 10-15 minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince this is a race pace workout, it is a great time to practice your nutrition strategies prior to race day. Aim to consume 50-75g of carbohydrates per hour. Note that the maximum fuel your body can process in 60 minutes is 90 grams, but only if 60g comes from glucose and 30g from fructose.

This gives you the opportunity to practice T2, so make sure to have your running gear set up beforehand. When you finish the first bike session, dismount, transition, and complete the first brick run (details can be found in each of the \u201csplit brick\u201d run workout descriptions ). Upon finishing the run, take a few moments to eat and drink if necessary then hop back on the bike for the second set.\n\nThis workout is a great opportunity to practice a negative split pacing technique. Begin the first cycling session at 55% of FTP to get warmed up and gradually increase to 75%. Aim to hold 75% of FTP for the last 60-75 minutes.  On the second cycling set, begin at 70% and increase to 75% after about 15 minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince this is a race pace workout, it is a great time to practice your nutrition strategies prior to race day. Aim to consume 50-75g of carbohydrates per hour. Note that the maximum fuel your body can process in 60 minutes is 90 grams, but only if 60g comes from glucose and 30g from fructose. Unless you know the exact sugar breakdown of your nutrition do not aim for 90g per hour.\n\nIt is a good idea to weigh yourself before and after this session so you can determine if you are drinking enough.

Upon finishing the run, take a few moments to eat and drink if necessary and transition back to the bike for the second set.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\nFirst cycling session\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: Second cycling session\n\nSet 1: 45 minutes @ RPE 5-6 -- 110-120% of RTP --HR <90% (Z3)\n\nSet 2: 30 minutes @ RPE 5-6 -- 110-120% of RTP --HR <90% (Z3)\n\nRecovery: NA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\nAfter Set 2: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 145% of RTP -- HR <75% (Z1)\n",

This gives you the opportunity to practice T2, so make sure to have your running gear set up beforehand. When you finish the first bike session, dismount, transition, and complete the first brick run (details can be found in each of the \u201csplit brick\u201d run workout descriptions ). Upon finishing the run, take a few moments to eat and drink if necessary then hop back on the bike for the second set.\n\nThis workout is a great opportunity to practice a negative split pacing technique. Begin the first cycling session at 55% of FTP to get warmed up and gradually increase to 75%. Aim to hold 75% of FTP for at least the last 90 minutes. On the second cycling set, begin at 70% and increase to 75% after 10-15 minutes.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince this is a race pace workout, it is a great time to practice your nutrition strategies prior to race day. Aim to consume 50-75g of carbohydrates per hour. Note that the maximum fuel your body can process in 60 minutes is 90 grams, but only if 60g comes from glucose and 30g from fructose. Unless you know the exact sugar breakdown of your nutrition do not aim for 90g per hour.\n\nIt is a good idea to weigh yourself before and after this session so you can determine if you are drinking enough. Losing 1-2 pounds of water weight during this session is okay, any more than that and you need to reassess your hydration plan.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **(Only prior to first cycling session)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 2\n\nRest Between Sets: Your first Run session\n\nSet 1: 2 hours @ RPE 5 -- 70-75% of FTP -- HR <90% (Z3)\n\nSet 2: 90 minutes @ RPE 5 -- 70-75% of FTP -- HR <90% (Z3)\n\n\u200b\n\nRecovery:** **\n\nNA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nNA\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\nNA - Straight into Run 2!\n",

Shot from the hip, the film follows four cyclists as they ride the 4,000 kilometers from Chicago to Los Angeles and documents every moment of their adventure: the roads they ride and the people they meet. _Outskirts: Route 66_ is the first in a series of films chronicling epic adventures along the world\u2019s most famous roads.\n\n\u200b\n\n\ud83d\udeb4 Workout: This is a great way to watch a compelling documentary while developing your baseline aerobic fitness.

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70% \n\n1 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75% \n\n1 minute @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80% \n\n1 minute @ RPE 5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85% \n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90% \n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <95% \n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP) \n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 4 \n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75% \n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4 \n\n**Interval** \n\nSurge: 30 sec @ RPE 8.5 -- 90% of MAP (105-130% of FTP) \n\nSteady: 1 minutes 30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n13 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

However, he never won the Tour de France, finishing on the podium a record 8 times. Outclassed by the two super champions, Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merkx, both quintuple victors of the Tour de France, Raymond Poulidor still achieved an impressive fame, and a place in the heart of France, as 'The Eternal Second.' Filmed before his death in November 2019, this is a touching look into the lives of the people's champion.\n\n\u200b\n\n\ud83d\udeb4 Workout: While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training many of our videos dish out, riding to this Inspiration film is a great way to watch an interesting film while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.\n\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 110% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 3\n\n**Interval **\n\nEffort: 25 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 87% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\nRecovery: 15 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

Your bodies ability to clear out metabolites and process oxygen is nearly identical between 90% of FTP and 100% of FTP, the difference is that at 100% of FTP your body is producing those metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them. At 90% of FTP your body can clear things at the same rate, but your body isn't producing them at the same rate.\n\nLong Sub-Threshold efforts represent an effort that your body can just about handle (assuming you are properly fueled and not completely exhausted), clearing things out faster than they can accumulate. To really stress that clearance rate each of these Sub-Threshold efforts start with a 20-second effort well above FTP. By the time you settle into the Sub-Threshold effort, your body will be flooded with those metabolites that cause your legs and lungs to burn. However, since you are below FTP (clearing things out faster than you are producing them), the concentration of those metabolites will slowly drop over the course of the whole effort. Not only does this train your body to clear things faster, but it will also mentally prepare for the discomfort associated with efforts above FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor this session, we are asking you to dance on that razor's edge of your FTP, ideally the side that allows you to complete the session. If your legs or lungs aren't feeling great, you are better off dropping the steady effort by 5% and keeping the starting effort at 100%. Another component of this is settling into a good rhythm of breathing and pedaling. Everyone has a preferred cadence, and this is an instance where your preferred cadence supersedes the cadence targets onscreen. We want you dancing right on that edge of your comfort, and you can get much closer to that edge riding your preferred cadence.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: 3\n\nRest between sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n55 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

In the same way that longer Tempo efforts can feel \"easy,\" these shorter Sub-Threshold efforts can also feel \"easy\". After all, if you can hold 100% of FTP for about an hour, then holding less than that for 5-minutes should be a piece of cake right? We know you can go harder for 5-minutes, but that is not what we are asking for.\n\nThis session is not intended to push you to your limits, nor is it designed to be a massive training load. The real purpose is to essentially keep your fatigue levels right where they are, by giving your body just enough intensity to ensure that you are not \"more recovered\" after today.\n\nWhile some folks will say that there is no training benefit to such short Sub-Threshold efforts, when viewed in a bigger picture sense (like a 3-week training block) they can be the perfect efforts to ensure you get the most out of a longer training block.\n\nWe would even ask that you view this session as more of an assessment, rather than strictly a workout. That's because you should be comparing this power output to heart rate response and your own internal RPE. When you have heavy fatigue, your heart rate will struggle to hit its normal peaks. When fresh you would be getting into Z4 heart rate by the end of the last two intervals, and your RPE should never really climb above a 7. When holding onto excess fatigue, your heart rate won't climb above Z3, and your RPE will be above an 8. At the same time, if you have gained a significant amount of fitness, your Heart Rate will stay in Z3, and your RPE won't climb above 6. The secondary tell between improved fitness and fatigue is how quickly your heart rate drops after each effort. When fatigued, your heart rate won't drop below Z2 during the recovery.\n\nWhile it is easy to rely solely on Power, you should always refer back to RPE and Heart Rate, and today is the perfect session to practice comparing the 3.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 8\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 4 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\nRecovery: 5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n3 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- <45% of FTP -- HR < 60%\n",

Your bodies ability to clear out metabolites and process oxygen is nearly identical between 90% of FTP and 100% of FTP, the difference is that at 100% of FTP your body is producing those metabolites at the same rate it is clearing them.  At 90% of FTP your body can clear things at the same rate, but your body isn't producing them at the same rate.  \n\nLong Sub-Threshold efforts represent an effort that your body can just about handle (assuming you are properly fueled and not completely exhausted), clearing things out faster than they can accumulate.  To really stress that clearance rate each of these Sub-Threshold efforts start with a 20-second effort well above FTP.  By the time you settle into the Sub-Threshold effort, your body will be flooded with those metabolites that cause your legs and lungs to burn.  However, since you are below FTP (clearing things out faster than you are producing them), the concentration of those metabolites will slowly drop over the course of the whole effort.  Not only does this train your body to clear things faster, but it will also mentally prepare for the discomfort associated with efforts above FTP.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor this session, we are asking you to dance on that razor's edge of your FTP, ideally the side that allows you to complete the session.  If your legs or lungs aren't feeling great, you are better off dropping the steady effort by 5% and keeping the starting effort at 100%.\n\nAnother component of this is settling into a good rhythm of breathing and pedaling.  Everyone has a preferred cadence, and this is an instance where your preferred cadence supersedes the cadence targets onscreen.  We want you dancing right on that edge of your comfort, and you can get much closer to that edge riding your preferred cadence.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 5.5 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of sets: 2\n\nRest between sets: \n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval repeats per set: NA \n\n**Interval**\n\n20 seconds @ RPE 9.5 -- 180% of FTP -- HR >105%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6.5 -- 90% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n25 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down **\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 50% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

The then-26-year-old Belgian was taken to hospital with serious head injuries, including a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain, and was in a coma for months. At the time doctors feared he may never regain consciousness.\n\n\u200b\n\nStig's story is a universal story of the bad luck of one young man and his endless perseverance and positivity to overcome. It\u2019s a story of unconditional love from his family and friends. It\u2019s a story of hope and even though many of us won\u2019t face something as severe as Stig, we all struggle with life sometimes. There is a lesson in Stig\u2019s contagious smile for all of us.\n\n\u200b\n\n\ud83d\udeb4 Workout: While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, riding to this Inspiration film is a great way to watch an interesting film while developing your baseline aerobic fitness. The intensity of this workout will vary mostly between 60-70% of FTP, with heart rate remaining entirely in zone 2. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's how to turn off on-screen graphics for the best viewing experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterInspiration)\n",

Focus on targeting your skill weaknesses during this trail session in order to improve them come race day, when you want them to come naturally.\n\n\u200b\n\n**How?**\n\nThis is an unstructured ride - let the trail do the thinking today. If you find a section that you struggle to hit cleanly, repeat it a few times until you feel more comfortable with it. Don\u2019t feel the need to practice every section you struggle with on this ride, you don't want to get too frustrated and you can always come back another day! Keep the effort below 85% of FTP as best you can.\n\n\u200b\n\nMake sure to warm up before and cool down afterwards.\n",

That is not the point! If we wanted you to go harder, you would see a different workout in your Training Plan. We know you can go harder for 25-minutes, but that is not the point of a Tempo Session.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat many people don't realize is that your body's ability to process oxygen and metabolites is nearly identical from 80%-100% of FTP. The main change across that intensity range is the rate at which those metabolites are being generated. While you would get a slightly greater training load from doing this session at higher power, you would be adding more fatigue to your system than we want. That extra fatigue means you either need to ease off your workouts in the days leading up or ease off your workouts on the days after. From a big picture point of view that's no good! This session gives a great steady-state aerobic training load while leaving you fresh enough that you can hit training hard the days before and after. That means your training load over the entire week is often higher when you maintain restraint and stick to those Tempo Targets.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 6 -- 85% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n6 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort **\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 4\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 8 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\nRecovery: 12 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume **\n\n45 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \"Negative-Split\", meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \"easier\" tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\nThis session contains a single 60-minute tempo effort, broken into three 20-minute segments. You will spend the first 20-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 20 at 84%, and the final 20 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled, mental fatigue, all of these will play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling.\nThis can be a great session to act as a \"wake up call\" on any poor training habits you might have, so take note of them and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: NA\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n20 minutes@ RPE 6.5 -- 84% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 87% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

To keep you both company, he's invited his good friend Marcus, co-Founder of the Ride for Racial Justice. After visiting the scene of some local criterium races, the three of you head onto the trails and roads that make Boulder such a hotbed of gravel cycling. Along the way, you'll listen as the guys talk trash and even get some coaching tips from Neal before you finish with a burrito and a dip in the local creek. It's the perfect finish to an epic week in Boulder with Neal Henderson.\n\n\u200b\n\n**When to ride: Do this on day 6 of the 7-day plan.**\n\n\u200b\n\n_About Neal: The Head of Sports Science for Wahoo Fitness, Neal Henderson is one of the most accomplished coaches in cycling and multi-sport.

The goal of this session is to accumulate a significant amount of time near your VO2max, or the point at which your body is consuming as much oxygen as it possibly can. That means your heart rate and breathing rate will both be near their max by the end of each interval, especially in the final few intervals.\n\n\u200b\n\nSince it takes time for your heart rate and breathing rate to match your effort, for the first part of each interval, you will be tapping into your Anaerobic Capacity to produce the required power. To account for this, we have limited the recovery duration to be equal to the interval duration. Limited recovery ensures that you will drain your Anaerobic Capacity before the end of the intervals, meaning your body will be forced to produce as much power as possible using oxygen.\n\nPushing your aerobic system to its max like this is not just great for improving MAP, but also your FTP. Since MAP limits your FTP, improving your MAP is vital to the continued growth of your FTP. By the end of this session, you will have accumulated 20-minutes near your Maximal Aerobic Power, which will leave your legs aching and your lungs burning.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up **\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <65%\n\n4 minutes @ RPE 3 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n2 minute @ RPE 3.5 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <80%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 4.5 -- 75% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n30 seconds @ RPE 9 -- 90-95% of AC (130-180% of FTP)\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <75%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: N/A\n\nInterval Repeats Per set: 8\n\n**Interval**\n\nEffort: 2 minutes @ RPE 9 -- 100% of MAP (115-135% of FTP)\n\nRecovery: 2 minutes @ RPE 2 -- <45% of FTP\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n1 hour @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

It is vital in maintaining optimal posture during cycling and running in addition to water position in swimming. In this first session, we introduce some basic movements that focus on the activation and stabilization of posterior chain muscles. These moves include a combination of eccentric (lengthening), concentric (shortening), and isometric (holding) contractions. They provide your body with the foundation for more demanding moves to come. This is also a good session to come back to if you feel like you could use a quick posterior chain activation or tune-up.\n\n\u200b\n\nUnsure if this is the correct strength level for you?

As the Team Leader at Rally Cycling, you're riding to defend a respectable 22nd position in the GC\u2014and perhaps even break the top 10. Today's stage is on a hilly, punchy circuit. You'll need to put in some serious work to stay with the GC leaders if you want a chance of grabbing a top 10 GC result at the end of the Tour.\n\n\u200b\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00ae profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00ae profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It's the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n",

While we are all about the High-Intensity Interval Training that most of our videos dish out, there are just times in a well-structured training plan that a proper Endurance/Base ride is just what your body needs. This session will add minimal fatigue to your system, while still giving your aerobic engine the workload it needs to continue progressing. Steady Long Endurance rides are one of the best ways to cap off a long 2 or 3-week training block when your fatigue is high, your legs are tired, but you have just a bit more to squeeze out of yourself before you take your rest week. Shorter Endurance rides (like this one) can fit in both a hard week of training and a recovery week. That is, only if you do it right!\n\nMost people ride too hard when they head out for their \"base miles.\"\n\nSo what does a \"proper\" Zone 2 ride look like?\n\nFor 90% of the ride, you should stay between 55% and 65% of your FTP, at times going up to 70%, but not over. (To spice things up, we have broken this session into 10-minute segments alternating from 60 to 65% of FTP.)\n\nYour heart rate should be sitting in mid to low Zone 2 heart rate, which is 70-80% of LTHR, up to 85% of LTHR, but not for long. It would be best if you held the highest comfortable cadence you can, for most this is 80-90rpm\n\nAlso, your RPE should be a 2-3\n\nSounds simple right? It's actually one of the harder sessions to get right because you spend most of the time questioning why you are riding so easy, and if this is really going to make you fitter and faster. You will have to trust us on that one! When you see this session in your Training Plan, follow these instructions! Or you might just pay for it when your next hard session comes around.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of Sets: 1\n\nRest Between Sets: 10 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\nInterval Repeats per Set: 13\n\n**Interval**\n\n10 minutes @ RPE 4 -- 65% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\nN/A\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 2 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",

To get you ready, Phil is taking us over to the iconic Griffith Park in the Santa Monica mountains for a session of \u2018Openers.\u2019 These efforts will get your body ready for the workouts you have coming up without generating any real fatigue.\n\n\u200b\n\nDuring the warm-up, Phil gives a history lesson on the park, explains how his career developed, his connection to Quentin Tarantino and points out all of the world-famous museums that he has never set foot in.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn between intervals, Phil takes you behind-the-scenes of his many side hustles and explains why and how he started his different business ventures. As we wrap up the session it\u2019s time for a little post-ride treat: some homemade cookies baked by the man himself.\n\n\u200b\n\n_Do this on: Day 2 of the 5-day plan._\n",

You've just come off the Tour de France, where you set up your team's sprinter, Caleb Ewan, for three stage wins. All eyes on you to deliver another big result. But with the accumulated fatigue of back-to-back days of racing, there's some question as to whether your team can deliver the goods. Jump into the action for 53km of fast and furious racing through the streets of London to see if you can help pull off another win.\n\n\u200b\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of being a professional cyclist, now\u2019s your chance. The SYSTM ProRide series allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to be in the biggest bike races in the world, thanks to the SYSTM 4DP\u00ae platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00ae profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00ae profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It's the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

While not an out-and-out sprinter, you\u2019re the fast man of the AG2R Citroen team. You don\u2019t have a leadout so you\u2019re on your own to grab a result. Do you have what it takes to go it alone and secure the win?\n\n\u200b\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nHere\u2019s your chance to experience what it\u2019s like to ride in the biggest races in the world, thanks to SYSTM\u2019s 4DP platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00ae profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00ae profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It's the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

With long recoveries in between sets, you shouldn't have a problem hitting your targets, but it is still quite a challenging session. While you don't need to be fully rested and tapered as you would for a test session, you'll still want to come into this session feeling fairly fresh. \nAlso, just a friendly reminder that this workout is best done in level mode. You could certainly get away with starting in ERG mode and changing to Level mode when you get to the 30-second set (3rd set), however, riding the whole thing in level mode can be a good challenge, especially if you tend to use ERG mode most of the time. \n\nAre you up for a \"little\" challenge?\n",

That said, the 3-minute recoveries between intervals will seem much, much shorter. \n",

It's you against the clock in the race of truth.\n\n\u200b\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of being a professional cyclist, now\u2019s your chance. The SYSTM ProRide series allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to be in the biggest bike races in the world, thanks to the SYSTM 4DP\u00ae platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00ae profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00ae profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It's the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Featured Footage: **Velon\n",

Unfortunately, you're more of a flatland time trial specialist than a mountain goat. You'll have to dig deep into your suitcase of courage to stay with the climbers and make it to the finish with your legs and your dignity intact.\n\n\u200b\n\n**About ProRides**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever dreamed of being a professional cyclist, now\u2019s your chance. The SYSTM ProRide series allows you to experience what it\u2019s like to be in the biggest bike races in the world, thanks to the SYSTM 4DP\u00ae platform. We\u2019ve taken the first-person camera footage and power data from a pro cyclist and analyzed it to determine which part of their 4DP\u00ae profile each of their efforts corresponds to. But since few of us can put down pro-level watts, we made it so all of the efforts are scaled to your own personal 4DP\u00ae profile. That means you get to experience exactly what the pros experience relative to your own abilities. When they sprint, you sprint. When they attack, you attack. When they sit up, you get to take it (relatively) easy. It's the most immersive, realistic race simulation out there. Note: To ensure the most immersive riding experience possible, this workout does not have music, sound effects, heart rate, or cadence targets.\n\n\u200b\n\n[Here's some more information on how to create the most immersive ProRides experience.](https://wahoosystm.com/HelpCenterProRides)\n\n\u200b\n\n**Featured Footage:** Velon\n",

We are taking that pacing demand a bit further in this session by forcing you to slightly increase your effort as time goes on. This is referred to as a \"Negative-Split\", meaning the second half is faster (or you hold a higher power) than the first half.\n\nWhile you might question the benefit of doing \"easier\" tempo efforts, the truth is when riding between 80% and 100% of FTP your body processes oxygen and metabolites at nearly the same rate. Holding a higher power will give you a higher single day training stimulus, but looking at the big picture that can have its drawbacks. Mainly the fatigue those harder sessions cause, which requires easier workouts the days before and after. Sticking to the Tempo targets gets you nearly the same training stimulus while allowing you to hit harder sessions the rest of the week.\n\nThis session contains a single 60-minute tempo effort, broken into three 20-minute segments. You will spend the first 20-minutes at 80% of FTP, the next 20 at 84%, and the final 20 at 87%. By the time you hit the last 10-minutes of this effort, that 87% will feel much harder than it should. Another way of thinking about this one, if you were to reverse the order, and start at 87%, what you would likely find is that your RPE stays fairly consistent for the entire effort, even though the power targets are dropping.\n\nOverheating, not drinking enough, being under-fueled, mental fatigue, all of these will play a factor in how you feel in that final block. They will also impact your heart rate. While these power targets are usually associated with Zone 3 heart rate, many people will see their heart rate climb into low Z4 if they are not hydrating properly, or have inadequate cooling.\nThis can be a great session to act as a \"wake up call\" on any poor training habits you might have, so take note of them and aim to address those issues during your next workout.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Warm Up**\n\n30 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7 -- 95% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 7.5 -- 100% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n1 minute @ RPE 8 -- 105% of FTP -- HR <100%\n\n7 minutes @ RPE 2.5 -- 55% of FTP -- HR <70%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Main Effort**\n\nNumber of sets: NA\n\nRest between sets: NA\n\nInterval repeats per: NA\n\n\n**Interval**\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 6 -- 80% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n20 minutes@ RPE 6.5 -- 84% of FTP -- HR <90%\n\n20 minutes @ RPE 7 -- 87% of FTP -- HR <95%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Extra Volume**\n\n15 minutes @ RPE 3.5 -- 60% of FTP -- HR <85%\n\n\u200b\n\n**Cool Down**\n\n5 minutes @ RPE 1.5 -- 45% of FTP -- HR <70%\n",
